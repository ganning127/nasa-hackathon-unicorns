There are well over 300,000 active SKYWARN Weather Spotters in the U.S. Spotters are concerned citizens, amateur radio operators, truck drivers, mariners, airplane pilots, emergency management personnel, and public safety officials who volunteer their time and energy to report on hazardous weather impacting their community. The first steps in becoming an official NWS SKYWARN Weather Spotter is to complete training on weather hazards and their reporting in your area. Classroom type training is typically offered each Spring and Fall. To find the next available training provided by your local NWS forecast office please visit this interactive map: http://www.nws.noaa.gov/skywarn/skywarn.htm In partnership with the COMET00ae Program, which is part of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research&#39;s Community Programs supplemental national web-based training was also created.

Reversing these declines requires an understanding of the habitat needs of forest birds throughout their life cycle. This research focuses specifically on the 1-2 month period between nesting and migration, a period of the life cycle which isn&#39;t well studied. This is a formal study which involves a dedicated group of citizen scientists. there is also an associated outreach and education program, which is held through the Jamestown, NY Audubon Society for five Saturdays every spring, beginning the last Saturday in April. I am combining these two projects for the purpose of this database. The larger outreach and education project allows more informal opportunities for citizen science, and data collected through that effort is still entered in the (North American) Bird Point Count Database for scientific use.",

Many US fisheries harvest healthy target stocks, however, bycatch of non-target species is common, and can result in large-scale fishery closures. Technological advancements in remote sensing over the past decade have revolutionized the way fishermen target ocean resources and the amount of data available on the ocean environment. In partnership with the California drift gillnet fishery and National Marine Fisheries Service, we aim to use these data to balance protection of ecological resources and economic viability. The objective of this Feasibility Study Project is to evaluate the applicability of EcoCatch, a near real-time, multi-species fisheries management tool. Our approach will build on previous NASA-funded projects, TurtleWatch and WhaleWatch, that couple spatial data of protected species with remotely-sensed data to successfully reduce bycatch and other human impacts. We will use remotely sensed satellite oceanographic, fisheries and satellite tracking data to produce near-real time spatial models of target catch and bycatch, assimilating additional information from fishermen input. Our objective is to develop a predictive tool that will enhance conservation of protected and non-target species, while maintaining sustainability and profitability of the fishery.",

The Greater Atlanta Pollinator Partnership (GAPP) was initiated in 2011 because of the rapid loss of habitat and increase in pesticide use caused by the housing boom of the 1990s and early 2000s. Over this 20-year period, approximately 400,000 acres of green space were lost.  Goals of the GAPP are to encourage restoration and development of pollinator habitat at a landscape scale that is ecologically significant; consequently, we designed our project to focus on an area within a 25 - mile radius around downtown Atlanta, Georgia. This comprises nearly 1.2 million acres of potential pollinator habitat and includes all major public lands in metropolitan Atlanta and thousands of individual residences. Within this area, efforts focus on restoring pollinator-friendly habitat and educating the public through formal and informal opportunities.  Key components of the GAPP include using native species when available, rescuing native plants from construction sites, controlling invasive species, establishing community gardens, citizen science projects, conservation, education, research, and website development.  The GAPP website (http://gapp.org/) is critical to our online garden registration and mapping so we can track garden establishment, assess habitat development trends including identifying where corridors are developing or where more effort is needed, provide online educational materials, and provide focus to the effort through a newsletter. Through the GAPP, Bombus pensylvanicus, a rare and declining species, has been documented in a community garden in downtown Atlanta.  This indicates even rare species can be conserved in urban environments if the appropriate species are planted.  Funding for the Greater Atlanta Pollinator Partnership is limited, so synergy through partnerships is the key to success.",

Forest Service staff did not have the resources needed to adequately cover the monitoring needs therefore creating an ideal situation where volunteer citizen scientists could assist to collect critical information that will inform decisions and engage people in a timely and meaningful wildlife project. The spring of 2011 represented the second year of this data collection effort. The project is expected to continue through 2012 or 2015 (3-5 years total). Project Background The Gros Ventre drainage is critically important for many wildlife species and was a primary focus during the motor vehicle planning process. The new motor vehicle designations made some significant changes in this drainage to reduce impacts on wildlife, reduce maintenance costs and improve the ability to enforce travel regulations.  One change was a new seasonal restriction prohibited public motor vehicle use until June 1st in the upper portion of the drainage beyond the Slate/Crystal Creek junction. This change was primarily intended to protect the native soil road surface in the upper portion of the drainage thereby reducing road maintenance costs and to benefit wildlife during the transition from winter to summer range. Existing data shows that the drainage is important for elk calving, pronghorn antelope migration, bighorn sheep, as well as sage grouse leks. The USFS and Nature Mapping wanted to establish a baseline and gain more knowledge about how animals were distributed in the drainage during the critical spring transition from wintering to summering grounds. Gathering this information consistently each year provides critical information on the efficacy of the seasonal restriction.",

Using monitoring tools and processes, students test local water quality to gather data. They are testing factors like dissolved oxygen, pH and phosphate levels, temperature, and turbidity. They then work with city engineers and STEM professionals to learn what their data indicates, how stormwater management works, and how human activity contributes to runoff. From this investigation, students assess the most pressing environmental issue affecting their community2019s resiliency, research that issue, and engineer and execute a sustainable plan.",

TED archives the earthquake time, region, magnitude and hypocenter (latitude, longitude and depth). It also records the source of the scientifically derived earthquake information. TED detects two to three earthquakes a day, on average.

The number of insects emerging from a river is a function of larval population abundance in a river, so quantifying insect emergence might also be a useful proxy for standard benthic monitoring of insects; benthic monitoring in Grand Canyon is extremely challenging because of swift currents, deep water, and daily hydropeaking. In 2012 we started collaborating with commercial river guides (http://www.gcrg.org/) and Grand Canyon Youth (http://www.gcyouth.org/) to quantify insect emergence throughout the 240 mile long segment of the Colorado River in Marble and Grand Canyon.  Each night in camp, guides put out a simple light trap to collect flying insects.  After one hour, the light was turned off, the sample poured into a collection bottle, and some notes were recorded in a field book.

Two specific questions will be addressed with an experiment: How does the timing of plant growth interact with goose arrival time to alter summer-long magnitudes of plant production, foliar chemistry, and availability; and, How does the timing of plant growth interact with goose arrival time to alter summer-long magnitudes of net ecosystem CO2 exchange, gross ecosystem photosynthesis, and ecosystem respiration?",

More than half the estuaries in the US show some level of impairment due to excess.

This project is addressing the environmental, social and economic aspects of urban coastal sustainability and is producing insights that could transform assessments and management of coastal sustainability across the globe.  The research will resolve key uncertainties about nitrogen dynamics in a vitally important, increasingly common and dynamic land use type in the coastal zone, and directly address the human social and economic factors that underlie the capacity for improving these dynamics:  How efficient are stream restoration and installation of green infrastructure in reducing nitrogen delivery to the coast?  Are these effects easily overwhelmed by degradation of fundamental sanitary infrastructure?  Do coastal residents of different socio-economic status and distance to the coast really know and care about the ecological integrity of receiving waters?  Can their knowledge and interest be increased with citizen science efforts?  Answers to these questions will point the way forward for cities to address a key component of coastal sustainability on a sounder biophysical, social and economic footing.",

Therefore, in this project, we ask for help from citizen scientists, who will have the opportunity to learn to characterize and classify potentially new sources of noise in the LIGO system; working in concert with machine-learning algorithms to amplify the work of the citizen scientists, this project helps scientists narrow their focus to gravitational wave sources and develop citizen science methods that can scale with upcoming data-intensive scientific endeavors.",

The envisioned implementation targets the unique scientific and societal domain offered by cyber-enabled citizen science environmental control in the highly polluted Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn. The proposed  Brooklyn Atlantis  citizen science system consists of an array of mobile instrumented buoys for water monitoring with wireless capabilities, controlled by volunteers using a web-based peer-production system. Through the integration of dynamical systems theory, marine robotics, and technology-mediated social participation, the project will develop: 1) a model for complex systems comprising networks of humans and machines with a focus on technology-mediated social participation systems; 2) design guidelines for peer production systems to enhance participation in citizen science projects; and 3) a cyber-human infrastructure for real time monitoring and hazard detection of the natural environment combining mobile robotic sensor networks and human operated control systems. The broader impacts of this project include: 1) establishing a technology-based avenue for enhancing local community citizenry and engagement; 2) developing citizen based environmental monitoring platforms that could provide life-saving advantages; 3) leveraging interactive robotics, environmental awareness, and citizen science to foster interest and engagement in STEM fields among the general public and K-12 students; 4) fostering multidisciplinary thinking among NYU-Poly students; 5) promoting the awareness of citizen science capabilities among researchers; and 6) integrating research components in outreach programs. This project has the potential of transforming the field of dynamical systems through the integration of collective human intelligence in the design and adaption of engineered architectures. Similarly, it may transform thinking on social peer production systems to incorporate real-time mobile interactive machines and task co-execution.",

        "descrip": "In the era of data-intensive scientific discovery, Big Data scientists in all communities spend the majority of their time and effort collecting, integrating, curating, transforming, and assessing quality before actually performing discovery analysis. Some endeavors may even start from information not being available and accessible in digital form, and when it is available, it is often in non-structured form, not compatible with analytics tools that require structured and uniformly-formatted data. Two main methods to deal with the volume and variety of data as well as to accelerate the rate of digitization have been to apply crowdsourcing or machine-learning solutions. However, very little has been done to simultaneously take advantage of both types of solutions, and to make it easier for different efforts to share and reuse developed software elements. The vision of the Human- and Machine-Intelligent Network (HuMaIN) project is to accelerate scientific data digitization through fundamental advances in the integration and mutual cooperation between human and machine processing in order to handle practical hurdles and bottlenecks present in scientific data digitization. Even though HuMaIN concentrates on digitization tasks faced by the biodiversity community, the software elements being developed are generic in nature, and expected to be applicable to other scientific domains (e.g., exploring the surface of the moon for craters require the same type of crowdsourcing tool as finding words in text, and the same questions of whether machine-learning tools could provide similar results can be tested). The HuMaIN project proposes to conduct research and develop the following software elements: (a) configurable Machine-Learning applications for scientific data digitization (e.g., Optical Character Recognition and Natural Language Processing), which will be made automatically available as RESTful services for increasing the ability of HuMaIN software elements to interoperate with other elements while decreasing the software development time via a new application specification language; (b) workflows leading to a cyber-human coordination system that will take advantage of feedback loops (e.g., based on consensus of crowdsourced data and its quality) for self-adaptation to changes and increased sustainability of the overall system, (c) new crowdsourcing micro-tasks with ability of being reusable for a variety of scenarios and containing user activity sensors for studying time-effective user interfaces, and (d) services to support automated creation and configuration of crowdsourcing workflows on demand to fit the needs of individual groups. A cloud-based system will be deployed to provide the necessary execution environment with traceability of service executions involved in cyber-human workflows, and cost-effectiveness analysis of all the software elements developed in this project will provide assessment and evaluation of long standing what-if scenarios pertaining human- and machine-intelligent tasks. Crowdsourcing activities will attract a wide range of users with tasks that require low expertise, and at the same time it will expose volunteers to applied science and engineering, potentially attracting interest of K-12 teachers and students.",

Step 1: We must first finalize our understanding of how a mobile phone approach the fidelity of more advanced, costly instrumentation specifically designed to measure wireless behavior in terms of course metrics such as signal strength and spectral activity. 2. Step 2: From there, channel modeling to the degree that primary (e.g., line-of-sight) paths or secondary (e.g., multiple non-direct) paths are understood for diverse types of environments and/or geographical factors must then be studied. For example, we will characterize a mountainous region (versus the flat DFW area) as I will teach a course at SMU in Taos this summer called Mobile Phone Embedded Design (EE 5378/7378), where spectral activity, wireless propagation, and structural health of unique infrastructure will be measured in the Taos region. 3. Step 3: More generally, we then will investigate what role does geographical information (such as LIDAR data) has on the performance of wireless networks by isolating each effect (e.g., tree canopy height and width, land use, amount of free space, and building height and area). The detailed understanding obtained here will help tremendously for the spatial dimensions that are emerging as problematic for such applications as dynamic spectrum access. 4. Step 4: Finally, we will focus on our works impact on the standardization efforts (e.g., License Assisted Access), dynamic spectrum access, and broader-reaching applications for the crowdsourced based understanding of wireless environments including continue to pursue commercialization that is a result of NSF I-Corps as well as the multi- disciplinary objectives discussed above.",

        "descrip": "The naming and classifying of living organisms is a fundamental principal upon which biology is founded. Indeed, almost every facet of our lives - from the food we eat to the medicine we take, the houses we live in to the natural scenery we admire - has a connection to the biodiversity present on Earth. All species must be named and cataloged in order for humans to understand the world around us. The scientific field of taxonomy, responsible for identifying and describing species, has incurred a reduction in its specialist workforce in recent decades; this is unfortunate because the need for taxonomy has never been greater as human activities result in unprecedented decline in the diversity of life. This project will help to reduce the burden placed on current and future taxonomists to identify and catalog biodiversity by introducing a set of open-source, web-based tools for identifying species from images and for measuring imaged specimens for comparative studies. These software tools will be made freely available through the publicly-funded CyVerse web platform. In addition, a system for identifying dragonflies and damselflies called ODOMATIC will be implemented on an existing web presence, OdonataCentral, allowing researchers and enthusiasts to accurately identify these insects from images of their wings. A series of free workshops will be offered in diverse urban communities in New Jersey and Alabama to increase the diversity of OdonataCentral?s user base, encourage participation in the STEM fields, and generally increase appreciation and understanding of the natural world. A series of Google Hangout events will encourage international user-ship for ODOMATIC from World Dragonfly Association members in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. In addition, undergraduate students from Rutgers University-Newark will be recruited to help in designing and training ODOMATIC, giving them valuable experience in research, programming and taxonomy. This work will help to reduce the taxonomic impediment - an urgent need for more taxonomic products, like species descriptions and specimen identifications, from fewer taxonomist workers - by addressing the time-consuming, but necessary, task that is species identification. Objectives of this project include release of a newly-developed system for automatically identifying Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) from images of their wings, which uses computer vision and machine learning to characterize and classify species. An interface will be deployed making species identification using this system accessible through the OdonataCentral website (odonatacentral.org). In addition, stand-alone tools will be developed for automatically describing and placing geometric morphometric landmarks on specimens in biological imagery for use in morphology-based comparative studies. The successful completion of these objectives will benefit the odonatological community by providing dragonfly and damselfly identification. More broadly, the tools created here will allow biologists studying other groups of organisms to rapidly extract morphological data from images of their specimens.",

        "descrip": "This Frontier award supports the SONYC project, a smart cities initiative focused on developing a cyber-physical system (CPS) for the monitoring, analysis and mitigation of urban noise pollution. Noise pollution is one of the topmost quality of life issues for urban residents in the U.S. with proven effects on health, Education, the economy, and the environment. Yet, most cities lack the resources for continuously monitoring noise and understanding the contribution of individual sources, the tools to analyze patterns of noise pollution at city-scale, and the means to empower city agencies to take effective, data-driven action for noise mitigation. The SONYC project advances novel technological and socio-technical solutions that help address these needs. SONYC includes a distributed network of both sensors and people for large-scale noise monitoring. The sensors use low-cost, low-power technology, and cutting-edge machine listening techniques, to produce calibrated acoustic measurements and recognizing individual sound sources in real time. Citizen science methods are used to help urban residents connect to city agencies and each other, understand their noise footprint, and facilitate reporting and self-regulation. Crucially, SONYC utilizes big data solutions to analyze, retrieve and visualize information from sensors and citizens, creating a comprehensive acoustic model of the city that can be used to identify significant patterns of noise pollution. This data can in turn be used to drive the strategic application of noise code enforcement by city agencies, in a way that optimally reduces noise pollution. The entire system, integrating cyber, physical and social infrastructure, forms a closed loop of continuous sensing, analysis and actuation on the environment.  SONYC is an interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers at New York University and Ohio State University. It provides multiple educational opportunities to students at all levels, including an outreach initiative for K-12 STEM education. The project uses New York City as its focal point, involving partnerships with the city&#39;s Department of Environmental Protection, Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, the business improvement district of Lower Manhattan, and ARUP, one of the world&#39;s leaders in environmental acoustics. SONYC is an innovative and high-impact application of cyber-physical systems to the realm of smart cities, and potentially a catalyst for new CPS research at the intersection of engineering, data science and the social sciences. It provides a blueprint for the mitigation of noise pollution that can be applied to cities in the US and abroad, potentially affecting the quality of life of millions of people.",

        "descrip": "Introduction This project lays the foundations for a causal analysis of lay/expert collaborative research or citizen science. While the potential of such collaborations to advance knowledge and societal well-being are well known, little is known about what makes them succeed or fail. The PIs propose to bridge this gap by adopting a new approach that goes beyond traditional observational studies. The PIs propose to use mixed methods and an innovative parallel-study design. They will demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by examining the social conditions and processes that produce or forestall transformative, community-driven science in response to the current Gulf oil disaster. In addition, they plan to produce interdisciplinary and socially robust environmental knowledge about the impacts of the disaster by combining the expertise of environmental scientists, social scientists, and Vietnamese-Americans living and working in south Louisiana who bring their deep experiential knowledge of the region?s impacted ecosystems to the scientific work.  Intellectual Merits The proposed study is interdisciplinary. It is designed to advance basic social studies of science while simultaneously contributing to the production of socially robust environmental science. It s so in the form of two parallel analyses. The first is a community-driven toxicological study of wetlands contamination; the second is a sociological analysis of the initiation, development, and execution of that collaborative process. Both studies address substantively important problems. The community-driven study will investigate the exposure and impacts of petroleum hydrocarbons on finfish species that are culturally and economically important to Vietnamese-Americans whose livelihoods rely on commercial and subsistence fishing. Working together, residents and scientists will identify and prioritize target species and biological endpoints. The findings of the study will provide sound data that form the basis for hypothesis-driven future research on the long-term ecological impacts of the disaster. The sociological study will investigate the lay/expert collaboration for insight into the causal processes that generate successful citizen science.  Potential Broader Impacts  The interdisciplinary knowledge produced by this study will aid in scientific efforts to investigate the social and environmental impacts of the oil disaster by capturing time-sensitive social and ecological data that can be used by other natural and social scientists. The community-driven nature of the project and contributions to knowledge production by an underrepresented social group helps ensure that the scientific knowledge will be socially meaningful to Gulf Coast residents and local governments as well state and federal agencies working to mitigate disaster impacts. The project also holds significant educational opportunities. These include opportunities for interdisciplinary exchanges between social and natural scientists, and research training opportunities for undergraduate students and adult non-scientists. The project will also enhance institutional relationships between Tulane and Washington State Universities that bridge regional and public/private divides in the academy. Finally, the proposed study has strong potential to seed an effective and sustainable community-academic network for addressing ecological and environmental health issues in south Louisiana and elsewhere.",

Our tool features zoomable, high-resolution images for the 150 most commonly found taxa in the Eastern United States. Diagnostic characters for 50 selected taxa will have added multimedia annotations at the order, family, and genus level. These explorable images can be dynamically manipulated by the user to see and learn these important characters in context. Detailed descriptions of the diagnostic characters, life history, food preferences, ecological information, pollution tolerance values, and terminology supports will be provided to aid identification for each taxon. Using design-based learning research and evaluation approaches, we will examine expert and learner practices through cognitive task analysis methods, and explore affordances of an innovative online field guide and collection of high-resolution aquatic macroinvertebrates images to facilitate science learning and engagement in taxonomic identification activities. This research study will help guide engagement and build capacity with scientists, citizen scientists, and informal science education (ISE) professionals to utilize new media technologies to facilitate public-science interactions and catalyze participatory kinds of science learning and research experiences with public audiences.",

        "descrip": "This project will develop theory, algorithms, and example systems for motivating large numbers of autonomous individuals to solve problems that require coordination in the physical world. In these  physical crowdsourcing  systems, people make small contributions toward a larger collective problem, such as tracking animal species or air quality for citizen science projects or providing rides or package delivery in commercial applications. In these systems, opportunistically relying on people to do convenient parts of the problem causes incomplete solutions, while directing people to do inconvenient tasks requires high incentives. By modeling the timing and location of tasks, along with knowledge of people&#39;s routines, the project will develop algorithms that make use of ideas from decision theory to best decide when, where and to whom to suggest tasks, in a way that balances individual convenience with system needs. Doing this should increase people&#39;s willingness to participate, reduce the need to incentivize participation, and create more complete, timely, and accurate solutions to the collective problem. The investigators will develop several prototype systems that address practical problems such as package delivery and lost and found searches to demonstrate the effectiveness of their ideas; they will also release a toolkit that allows other people to use their work when designing their own physical crowdsourcing systems for solving both scientific and practical problems of interest to society.  The work will be carried out in three main phases. The first phase will develop  incentive chaining , a strategy to encourage opportunistic contributors to become more directable. Using an existing prototype for surveying tree species, the team will model people&#39;s opportunistic contributions and routines, then suggest relatively easy  nearby  tasks where others have contributed but where further work is needed, building people&#39;s interest and capacity to contribute. Once the nearby collaborative tasks are done, the system will direct these experienced and motivated contributors toward new areas and tasks, which will in turn become the  nearby  contributions that attract the next round of contributors. The second phase will develop decision-theoretic hit-or-wait algorithms to decide if and when to notify contributors about tasks, using a community-based lost and found application. Building on the modeling of behavioral routines, these algorithms will use sequential decision processes to estimate the maximize total value of tasks that contributors will complete, given individuals&#39; history and current state, the system-determined value of nearby tasks, and the system&#39;s estimate of how likely the contributor would be to respond to a notification. The third phase will develop notification policies that satisfy the system&#39;s quality of service needs while minimizing disruption to contributors. To do this, the investigators will develop a supply management framework that considers the pool of available helpers, the current task demand and values, and a range of policies for making directed requests and evaluate it in the context of a peer-to-peer package delivery system.",

Wilson Biodiversity Foundation, along with the National Park Service, Discover Life in America and Turner Endangered Species Fund, formed our team of four Duke University students as the first of many groups of students to travel to protected areas and develop approaches to conduct biodiversity research that can inform its conservation. Our team assessed the current status of biodiversity research at Rocky Mountain National Park to determine major gaps in the understanding of biodiversity. We used various data sources to find species lists from research conducted in the Park to ensure that the National Park Species Database was updated with the most recent information. Our team added 667 species to the database through this process. One of the identified gaps was a lack of research on spiders in the park. We piloted a field study on spider biodiversity to identify species existing in the park and to understand their ecological roles. Our resulting field study added 102 new spider species to the park database. We also conducted a mini-Bioblitz with adults and children in order to foster an interest in citizen science activities. Finally, we created a video to create awareness about our topic, foster curiosity, and spark interest in the area of science and biodiversity.",

Collaboration throughout the project enabled partner organizations to share activities and knowledge in both informal education and the significance of marsh ecosystems. The project served 45 staff (educators and scientists) and 547 youth over two years across New England. The project funding ended in December 2015, but we have made our data, protocol and data sheets available on CitSci.org. We know some of our original camps will continue to collect data, and hope we can inspire others to adopt it as well.  The project was successful in supporting environmental stewardship in all involved. Educators and scientists benefited from working together closely. We found that a strong connection between the scientist and educators increased enthusiasm which was then expressed at camp. Our two day training2019s at the beginning of each year helped with this connection. The campers came in describing salt marshes as smelly, muddy places and left the program describing marshes as barriers, food sources, and filters. The campers changed their view from self-focused to an ecosystem focus. This awareness of marsh functions will likely lead to increased environmental stewardship. In fact, parent surveys in the Fall following camp reported that the majority of campers had taken actions to protect the environment.",

The knowledge and expertise of these groups have allowed us to collect new data on the life-history characteristics, population abundance, fisheries interactions and genetic structure of ESA-listed rockfish in PS across several research projects. These new data have led to the re-drawing of population boundaries for yelloweye rockfish (S. ruberrimus) and the removal of canary rockfish (S. pinniger) from the endangered species list.",

Digital twin technology is one of those challenges. In July 2020, 30 multidisciplinary scientists participated in a five-day interactive event, the NCI-DOE Collaboration Virtual Ideas Lab: Toward Building a Cancer Patient &#39;Digital Twin&#39;. They formed new collaborations and created innovative research projects focusing on a digital twin component that, within the next 2-3 years, will advance the development of a model of an individual cancer patient. Six multidisciplinary mentors from government, academia, and industry advised the project teams. Over 130 scientists applied. Participants were selected to create a balance of diverse expertise, career-level and demographics. A digital twin is a computer replica of the systems and processes needed to run simulations without disrupting or harming the real-world object. A digital twin would be a real-life replica of the human body able to show outcomes in the present and future. A cancer patient&#39;s digital twin (aka, avatar or virtual patient) could be used as a holistic computer-based model to enable personalized medicine, support  cancer research, pre-clinical development, clinical trials, aid diagnosis and support running treatment simulations.

These data can be used for multiple purposes, such as archiving where flowing water is present in forest planning units, informing modeling efforts of streamflow permanence, and providing information needed to update stream classifications across any spatial extent. FLOwPER uses the ArcGIS Online (AGOL) Survey123 platform, which operates on a variety of mobile devices, including those from agencies and personal mobile devices. FLOwPER is designed for seamless communication with ArcGIS online for easy uploading of collected observations into a publicly available master database (FLOwPER Database) that can include any geographic region. FLOwPER focuses on the rapid collection of a set of simple visual observations that can be recorded from a road over a stream or while standing on the bank of a stream. Use of FLOwPER requires a mobile device that can access the FLOwPER field form through the Survey123 app and an accurate Global Positioning System (GPS) antenna with a rated accuracy of 1 meter or less. With crowdsourced observations collected by many users of FLOwPER, it is possible to collect a large number of observations from a wide geographical range from all parts of the stream network at any time of the year. Although seasonal drying of streams is often of interest, FLOwPER can be used to evaluate patterns of flow permanence at any time of year, including times when stream networks are greatly expanded during wet cycles.",

For example, the incidence of dengue, a vector-borne disease affecting approximately 100 million people per year, can increase 3-5 fold during an epidemic, yet no clear indicator of the intensity or timing of an epidemic exists until it is already underway. Influenza and other globally important diseases present similar challenges. Advances in forecasting for these diseases and others are continually occurring, yet research gaps limit forecasting model development, evaluation of forecasts, and adoption by decision-makers. The Epidemic Prediction Initiative (EPI) aims to improve the science and usability of forecasts by addressing these challenges. Since January 2016, EPI has published influenza forecasts from participating teams in real-time on the EPI website. This was the first time that infectious disease forecasts from multiple groups were published jointly in real-time, facilitating forecast comparison and evaluation by public health officials. EPI also initiated and maintains an open online repository of code and data related to epidemics. This activity aims to reduce redundancy in data cleaning, standardize data formats, and support forecasting research. Finally, EPI has been engaging in outreach efforts within CDC, among other federal government agencies, with state and international public health officials, and in the academic community to better understand how to improve forecast accuracy and how forecasts can be used in public health decision making. The collaborative approach of EPI is the basis for COVID-19 forecasting in the U.S., the largest scale real-time epidemic forecasting initiative to date.",

Faculty from Cal Poly and Moss Landing Marine Labs developed a scientifically rigorous hook-and-line survey in partnership with the NOAA Fisheries Southwest Fisheries Science Center and the recreational fishing industry (the Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel, or CPFV, fishing fleet), where vessels (including vessel Captain and crew) are chartered to conduct the survey, and volunteers conduct all of the sampling. During a sampling event, volunteer anglers are assigned a station aboard the fishing vessel to fish, while scientific staff collect information on the environmental conditions, the catch by species, size of each fish, and tag a subset of fish. The vast majority of fishes caught (with some exceptions for age data collections or other special studies) are released with descending devices to increase post-capture survivorship. In 2016, CCFRP was expanded statewide to include six partner academic institutions, monitoring 14 protected areas and 14 adjacent reference sites spanning the entire coast of California. Over 1,650 volunteer anglers have caught more than 150,000 fish since 2007.  The volunteers include all experience levels of anglers and ages from high school students to retirees. As one of the few citizen science programs contributing data to stock assessments and protected area management, the program inherently supports the sustainable management of domestic fisheries, and provides high-quality data to address a range of other management questions.

A cost-effective way to assess the performance of low-cost air sensors (and create data correction equations that make sensor data comparable to government monitors) is to test low-cost sensors near the more expensive technology at regulatory monitoring sites. This project sets up small testing enclosures that will be set up at regulatory air monitoring sites.

The program runs annually in New York and New Jersey to reflect the general sampling season (May-November). Beginning in 2018, to accommodate more communities, the program began working with the Caribbean Science Consortium to set up a formal system of Equipment Loan Centers with university partners throughout Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. There are currently seven centers in Puerto Rico and two in the US Virgin Islands, each with their own full set of equipment maintained by university staff. This project requests applications annually in February/March for NY and NJ and on a rolling basis in Puerto Rico and the USVI.",

This approach can supplement the current methods, i.e., deployment of hydrological measurement equipment (stream gauges), that is costly and requires specialized expertise. This user-friendly alternative relies on continuous photo imagery and machine learning to estimate streamflow. Water volume is a critical variable in maintaining both the health of aquatic and riparian biological communities and for human uses of water. However, in many parts of the country, flow regimes are changing due to anthropogenic changes and natural impacts. Today, the USGS maintains over 7,000 continuous water monitoring gages, but most are in large rivers and reduced funding has led to removal of gages. Therefore, many states, tribes, and other groups want to collect more hydrologic data, especially in small to mid-size streams. In this proof of concept project, the website &#39;Flow Pictures Explorer&#39; is being expanded as a publicly available repository for photos and hydrographs. State and tribal partners are supplying thousands of continuous photos from game cameras together with hydrological data for multiple stream sites. By using continuous imagery of streams with novel machine learning, states, tribes, nonprofits/watershed associations, and other groups will gain a better understanding of altered hydrology.",

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to lie down in your astronaut suit on the surface of Mars and look up at clouds in the Martian sky? While no humans have done so yet, we know that clouds are a regular phenomenon in Mars&#39;s atmosphere. With the help of telescopes, orbiters, and our rovers&#39; eyes, we&#39;ve been able to spot them for some time. Clouds are an important area of research on Mars (and on Earth, too) because of their feedback on the climate -- they can reflect incoming sunlight which has a cooling effect and absorb the planet&#39;s outgoing infrared radiation which has a warming effect. In fact, clouds may have played a crucial role in sustaining a warm atmosphere on early Mars enabling liquid water to flow and carve out channels we see in the geology today. Whereas Earth clouds are made of liquid water, the cold temperatures and low pressures of Mars today (which prevent liquid water) allow water-ice and carbon-dioxide ice clouds to form. The Mars Climate Sounder, an instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, is able to see clouds at very high altitudes (&gt;30 miles) in the Martian atmosphere and our goal is to map them to better understand their composition and how they form.

We sometimes see similar human-like behaviors appear among diverse populations of today2019s wild chimpanzees. If we study when, where, and how such behavior is more prominent, we can get a better idea of the evolutionary scenarios that led to the rise of our species.For this project, we have collected nearly 7,000 hours of footage, reflecting various chimpanzee habitats, from camera traps in 15 countries across Africa.

In the year 2000, the City of San Diego in collaboration with the San Diego Oceans Foundation, purchased, cleaned and deliberately sank a 366 foot-long Canadian warship called the Yukon to act as an artificial reef and attract local marine life, a task at which it is been spectacularly successful. In the 15 years that the Yukon has been sitting on the bottom off the coast of San Diego, it has attracted dozens of species of local marine life as well as a revenue-generating attraction for tourist divers from around the world.  The first scientific study of the marine life on the Yukon was undertaken in 2004 by Dr. Ed Parnell of Scripps Institution of Oceanography in collaboration with the San Diego Oceans Foundation. It utilized data gathered by local citizen science divers to generate an initial baseline study of the marine life species on the ship. 1  It too, will utilize local divers as citizen scientists to systematically gather data about the marine life species that have accumulated on the ship since 2004. The Yukon lies in 100 ft of water and is considered an advanced dive and should not be attempted except by those who have the proper training.Please Note: OS uses iNaturalist as our citizen science data collection tool.

You will be competing against a computer and other players in the community.Though it may appear to be just a game, Phylo is actually a framework for harnessing the computing power of mankind to solve a common problem -- Multiple Sequence Alignments.A sequence alignment is a way of arranging the sequences of DNA, RNA or protein to identify regions of similarity. These similarities may be consequences of functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships between the sequences. From such an alignment, biologists may infer shared evolutionary origins, identify functionally important sites, and illustrate mutation events. More importantly, biologists can trace the source of certain genetic diseases.Traditionally, multiple sequence alignment algorithms use computationally complex heuristics to align the sequences. Unfortunately, the use of heuristics do not guarantee global optimization as it would be prohibitively computationally expensive to achieve an optimal alignment. This is due in part to the sheer size of the genome, which consists of roughly three billion base pairs, and the increasing computational complexity resulting from each additional sequence in an alignment.Humans have evolved to recognize patterns and solve visual problems efficiently. By abstracting multiple sequence alignments to manipulating patterns consisting of coloured shapes, we have adapted the problem to benefit from human capabilities. By taking data which has already been aligned by a heuristic algorithm, we allow the user to optimize where the algorithm may have failed. All alignments were generously made available through UCSC Genome Browser. In fact, all alignments contain sections of human DNA which have been speculated to be linked to various genetic disorders, such as breast cancer. Every alignment is received, analyzed, and stored in a database, where it will eventually be re-introduced back into the global alignment as an optimization.Lets play!As seen in Chapter 5 of Citizen Science by Caren Cooper.",

Optionally, you can sample and count the larvae and try to identify the mosquito type, both of which will require additional equipment. Even a basic observation without optional elements is valuable! If possible, we also ask you to eliminate the mosquito breeding habitat.  Your observations are important because mosquitoes are a serious health risk: millions of people die each year from mosquito-borne disease. While climate and weather conditions can suggest to scientists where to expect spikes in mosquito populations during the year, we don2019t know for sure what is happening unless we make observations on the ground.

This reserve is within the meeting point of the three largest biomes of North America - tallgrass prairie, eastern deciduous forest and boreal coniferous forest - and is consequentially filled with a diverse array of floristic and faunal diversity. World-renowned scientists have made Cedar Creek their workplace from the beginning: the modern science of ecosystem ecology was conceived here in the 1940s. From the earliest work at Cedar Creek to the most modern experiments today, research has focused on ecology and the services ecosystems provide to the planet and to human society.Now, researchers at Cedar Creek are turning their attention to the wildlife. For decades, scientists have rigorously monitored, manipulated, and experimented with the incredible plant diversity within Cedar Creeks grassland and forest ecosystems: carbon has been measured, nitrogen fluxes quantified, seedlings meticulously counted. From this incredible body of work, we have discovered some amazing things about the functioning of the natural world. But - what about the animals?In addition to being home to dozens of long-term plant and soil biodiversity projects, Cedar Creek is also teeming with animal life. This diverse community of herbivores, predators, and meso-predators interact in complex ways that affect each other and the environment that they live in. Rodents are stealing seeds, deer are chowing down on grasses, and recently, wolves and bison are returning to this ecosystem after decades or centuries of absence. The contributions of these interactions to the structure and functioning of these ecosystems remain under-explored. To better understanding how these animals might affect these ecosystems, researchers have deployed a vast network of trail cameras across the Cedar Creek property. These cameras are triggered by motion and body heat to take pictures whenever wildlife pass in front of them, providing a peek into the 201csecret lives201d of the animal community. Over a hundred cameras have been set up, capturing high resolution data on the movement and activity patterns of more than two dozen species, including wolves, foxes, coyotes, deer, turkeys, and more. Your assistance going through these images and identifying species, recording behavior, and sharing your observations helps our scientists to understand whats happening on our landscape. These data are then combined with Cedar Creeks already comprehensive collection of plant and soil data to study how predators structure ecological communities and ecosystems.",

In this multi-phase study, we are trying to find out!Past work in our lab found that selective breeding has led to differences in the brain anatomy across dog breed groups, which is one reason for the different behaviors we see across breeds. But a crucial unanswered question is how this brain development and function is influenced by each dog2019s environment and life experiences. For example, if a dog has a history of traumatic experiences such as living in a shelter or being attacked by another dog, is he or she more likely to develop different behavior profiles and neural connections? To answer this question, we have designed 3 phases of the Dog Life Experience study. Phase 1: Online Surveys. The first phase (currently ongoing) consists of two separate online surveys that ask about your dog2019s past experiences and current behavior. The first survey will take approximately 15-25 minutes to complete, and the second survey is about 10-15 minutes. This phase is separate from the subsequent phases, and you2019re not obligated to participate in the later phases. Who can participate in Phase 1?

Minnesota offers a unique opportunity to look at this across four different biomes and a large metro area. These areas have differing topography, vegetation, and human land use. All of these things are likely to influence the different scavenger assemblages found in each area There are also several methods of hunting such as archery, rifle, and shotgun that may influence where a gut pile is located, and which species visit.We asked deer hunters in Minnesota to place remote cameras on gut piles from freshly field dressed deer. Volunteers left their cameras to capture pictures for one month to capture all the scavenger species that used the gut pile.Scavengers have been shown to obtain high quality food from carrion without using the energy needed to capture and kill prey. A large amount of carrion available to scavengers is provided by apex predators, such as wolves, or the natural death of prey. Likewise, at certain times of the year, hunters can provide a significant source of carrion in the form of gut piles. The resource pulse of gut piles that hunters provide generally occurs over a small area and short period of time. This pulse represents a large input of gut piles into the ecosystem from animals that would otherwise not be available to scavengers. Carrion pulses have the potential to reduce predation on prey species by providing a less risky meal for predators. Alternatively, predators that consume carrion may also increase predation pressure on prey populations in the same environment when the carrion pulse is depleted.Since gut piles are provided by human hunters, the suite of scavengers and time that animals scavenge is likely to differ from carrion left by predators. Mere human presence on the landscape may attract wildlife. For instance, similar to their response to wolf activity, ravens respond positively to the sound of gunshots, because it means easy food. Large carnivores such as gray wolves and bears may also be drawn to hunter provided gut piles.",

For more information, please visit www.fairchildgarden.org/gbe or twitter.com/GrowBeyondEarth.Growing Beyond Earth (GBE) is Fairchild2019s NASA-funded classroom science project designed to advance research on growing plants aboard spacecraft. As NASA looks toward a long-term human presence beyond Earth orbit, there are specific science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) challenges related to food production. GBE is addressing those challenges by expanding the diversity and quality of edible plants that can be grown in space. On Earth, GBE is also improving technologies for gardening in urban, indoor, and other resource-limited settings.Established in 2015 as a partnership between Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden and NASA2019s Exploration Research and Technology Programs, GBE is now underway in 130 Miami-Dade middle and high schools with a special focus on under-resourced, Title 1 schools. Beginning in 2018, 40 sites have been established outside Miami-Dade, in other Florida locations, and in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Utah, New York, Texas, California, and Puerto Rico.GBE is unique in its focus on real scientific research, enabling student 201ccitizen scientists201d to contribute data toward NASA mission planning. Each classroom receives a Fairchild-designed plant habitat that is analogous to the plant growing equipment aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Fairchild and NASA scientists train teachers to conduct in-classroom GBE experiments, and students then share experimental data online with NASA.Several new candidate plants have been identified for spaceflight through the GBE program. These include varieties of pak choi, cress, and kale that produced greater amounts of biomass than the varieties previously tested in NASA labs. We have observed that some plants can grow under a wide range of classroom environmental conditions, possibly indicating high adaptability and stress tolerance. Some of the best varieties from the 2015-2017 classroom studies are now in experimental trials at NASA Kennedy Space Center. To date 10 student-tested varieties have been selected by NASA researchers to be ground tested at Kennedy Space Center2019s GreenLab and in 2019 two of those varieties were tested aboard the ISS.GBE also provided an opportunity to test a new leaf vegetable harvesting strategy. The new strategy, involving frequent harvesting throughout the life of a plant, was shown to be successful in classrooms during the 2015-2016 school year and has subsequently been implemented on ISS.Teacher surveys indicate that GBE is improving STEMinstruction in middle and high schools. The program is uniquely effective in serving groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields, as defined by race, gender, and socioeconomic status. Through the program, students have become more knowledgeable about STEMtopics, more confident when participating in STEM activities, and more interested in STEMcareers. Students are also learning about the dietary importance of fresh vegetables for maintaining health.Throughout history, plants have been essential to exploration. Today2019s space travelers are continuing an ancient tradition, bringing food plants on voyages into new and unfamiliar environments. Schoolchildren can now participate in the next phase of human exploration, helping determine which plants might feed explorers on the way to Mars.",

That eclipse was only 2 minutes long, but provided the most accurate deflections ever recorded by a telescope on Earth. In 2024, an even better opportunity arises, and I am helping others make the most of it. The 2024 eclipse is more than twice as long, so with the same telescope, twice as many photons can be collected. In 2017, half of the time was spent taking calibration images. If a larger field of view camera is used, then the calibration can be done using stars further from the Sun. This also doubles the data collection. If the camera uses a full-frame (35mm) sensor, this captures an area 5.3 times larger, assuming the same telescope uses a field flattener with 0.8x reduction. In addition, the new CMOS cameras have a small overhead time, so the collection efficiency is doubled. Since there will be no need to take a series of shorter images to collect stars close to the limb, this adds another 20% improvement.  When all of these improvements are combined, the 2024 eclipse should collect 50 times more starlight! The limiting magnitude should be about 2.4 magnitudes dimmer, or a total of over 400 stars, compared to the 20 stars measured in 2017. The gravitational deflection coefficient might be four times better, or less than a 1% error.  The initial plan is to set up 10 telescopes, reducing the uncertainty by another factor of 3.  This would be the best measurement until the eclipses of 2027. An educational grant is being investigated to provide funding for equipment and travel.",

Each eggcase contains one embryo which will develop over several months into a miniature version of the adult. In waters around the British Isles, there are over ten species of skate and 3 species of shark that reproduce by laying eggcases. Eggcases vary in shape, size and features - these differences allow us to identify which species they came from. Once the juvenile has emerged, the much lighter empty eggcases can wash ashore and be found amongst the seaweed in the strandline. We also want people to record eggcases that are seen developing in-situ while snorkelling or diving!Empty eggcases are an easily accessible source of information on the whereabouts of potential nursery grounds and provide the Trust with a better understanding of species diversity and broad distribution.Thanks to public recording, the Trust now has an extensive database of eggcase records, with over 245,000 records as of July 2019. This database continues to provide crucial information about the distribution of British sharks, skates and rays.The project now extends well beyond the UK, and welcomes eggcase submissions from around the globe.

Mapping, researching and communicating building knowledge\" aims to collect information on Dresdens buildings in an open digital platform together with the population and thus make it visible and usable in maps. Together with the citizens, research questions have already been found and prioritized. In addition to general basic characteristics (building age, building structure, materiality, use, ), the focus should be on the resilience of buildings with regard to flood/heavy rain events or heat stress. Taking into account the requirements of historic preservation, among other things, the potential for structural climate adaptation measures can be shown. For these topics in the context of buildings, an appropriate building typology as well as suitable building characteristics and their recording methods will be defined. By building a digital platform that brings together this knowledge on buildings, opportunities for future development can be reflected, visualized, discussed and evaluated. The interactive thematic maps of the platform visualize the state of registration: the more colourful the map, the more building features have already been registered. The project includes a number of different activities and formats for participation. Together with the partners, actions are planned to convey knowledge about buildings and their recognition in the city (city walks, lecture series at the ZfBK, digital monthly regulars table, mapathons, school actions at DLR_School_Lab, etc.). The exchange of experience and networking with regard to technical implementation takes place through regular meetings or hackathons. A sustainable digital infrastructure ensures the open provision of project-related documents (the source code of the platform, workshop documentation, the collected data, etc.). Thus, the project aims to create suitable framework conditions to enable Citizen Science in Dresden in a sustainable way.

The delta provides food and shelter for those who call it home, as well as hurricane and flood protection, a flyway for migratory birds, recreational benefits, and more. Despite their economic and ecological value, Louisiana2019s wetlands are being lost at an alarming rate. Over 400 square miles of marshland have been lost to oil and gas activity alone. In response to this crisis, Cartoscope, in partnership with Healthy Gulf and Northeastern University, developed Land Loss Lookout, a citizen science tool that trains users to identify types of wetland loss in the Gulf of Mexico and label where such loss is occurring by categorizing color infrared aerial photographs. The project focuses on identifying the patterns associated with six significant types of land impact: agriculture, oil and gas, sea level rise, erosion, shipping, and restoration. When beginning Land Loss Lookout, participants are randomly assigned to look for just one of these categories and are then given a short tutorial on how to identify the unique patterns associated with their assigned type of land impact. Once participants have completed the tutorial, they may begin sorting through the image database and labeling whether or not their assigned land impact pattern is present. As participants label the photos, Cartoscope collects the geolocation information for each categorized image and plots the results on a map that is available to the research team and participants. This allows participants to view their own contributions and the contributions of others, while also playing an instrumental part in the effort to protect Louisiana2019s wetlands.Why is participating in Land Loss Lookout important to you? Heres what a few of our users said:\"Because preserving and protecting the environment for us and especially the next generation is extremely important to me.\"\"Wetland loss is very important to fighting the effects of climate change. I was born and raised in the Gulf Coast region, and it is close to my heart.\"\"Anything I can do to elevate and amplify the education of the public and the social movement toward caring action to defend our land is welcome.\"Additionally, after contributing to Land Loss Lookout, 78% of users who submitted feedback somewhat or strongly agreed that they would share the project with others!",

        "descrip": "On Drought (Na suchu) is a citizen science project investigating the current state of the agricultural landscape. It aims to jointly create a database monitoring the impacts of drought in Czech agriculture, to share examples of bad and good practices and thus contribute to a better future in the field of water retention in the landscape, a better yield of fields and more ecological management.  Whether you are a farmer, a farm landowner, or a random passerby, we will be happy if you get involved by taking photos directly in the field in agricultural areas and uploading them to iNaturalist. For observation, we are interested in 6 main categories:1. Solitary trees that are planted in the agricultural landscape in order to retain more moisture for cultural crops.2. Crops occurring in the fields. This category is further divided into two sections, indicate whether it is a monoculture (all around you, i.e. there is only one crop in the whole field) or, conversely, a combination of several crops.3. Biobelts and embankments. Biobelts are approximately 6 to 12 meters wide strips at the edges or inside the field on which plants other than on the rest of the field are grown. Their area is never harvested, they contribute to biodiversity and are also one of the anti-erosion measures. By embankment is meant a smaller area within the field, on which are planted mainly tree species. They have a beneficial impact on the surrounding landscape. They act as windbreaks, reduce water and wind erosion, are a source of food and nutrients, therefore contribute to biodiversity, help to retain water in the field and at the same time prevent the washing of nutrients into watercourses and groundwater.4. Restoring dirt roads. As a result of the intensification of agriculture, dirt roads have almost disappeared from the agricultural landscape, which paradoxically has an impact on people and their farming on these areas. Landowners and farmers have thus lost access to some agricultural areas and lost the opportunity to farm these lands. Roads also serve as a link between non-agricultural areas such as a village and a forest or a pond. However, dirt roads also have enormous benefits for the agricultural landscape. They serve as bunds to protect fields from water erosion. By planting shrubs and trees along the roads, the effects of wind erosion are reduced and water retention in the landscape is promoted.   5. Building pools and areas that could be used to retain water in the agricultural landscape. These include swales, which are ditches that retain rainwater. The aim of swales is to prevent water from running down the surface into the valley and soaking into the soil.   6. Planting fruit trees in agroforestry fields. This is a method of farming on agricultural (or forest) land that combines the growing of trees with some form of agricultural production on a single plot, either spatially or temporally.  And how to do it?When taking and inserting photos into the iNaturalist project, please follow these steps:1. Always take at least two photos of the element up close (to determine the species) and at a distance (if circumstances allow).- Photograph the solitary tree with an interval of approximately 10 m, then take a close-up of its detail (preferably a leaf or flower).- Photograph crops found in the fields in the context of the entire area of the field, then take a detailed picture of one plant.- Photograph the biobelts and embankments in the whole context so that their entire area can be seen, then take a close-up photo of the dominant species that prevails in the photographed area.- Photograph trees planted in agroforestry fields in the context of the whole field area, then take a close-up picture of one tree. 2. Specify or have the system fill in the species/genus of the plant you have recorded (this step is not necessary, you can leave the identification to us).3. For crops, indicate whether it is a monoculture or a combination of crops.4. Add your observations to the On Drought project (Na suchu) and fill in the attributes that the application will ask you to do.5. Indicate which category it is.Note: the type of plant is suggested by the iNaturalist program itself using artificial intelligence elements; date, time and position are filled in automatically if you have GPS position recording turned on on your phone.We welcome all those who will participate in the research and help scientists, farmers and landowners to jointly reduce the negative impacts of drought on the Czech agricultural landscape and preserve the fertility and cultural profitability of Czech fields for future generations.Thank you and we look forward to your observation!",

Academic ballooning uses weather balloons carrying payloads of experiments weighing a total of less than 12 pounds to altitudes of approximately 100,000 feet. At these altitudes 2013 above 99.5% of the atmosphere 2013 payloads experience a space-like environment. Academic ballooning types can be generalized into two categories: 1) atmospheric science radiosondes and 2) student-built engineering platforms. Radiosondes are small standardized commercial off-the-shelf payloads of less than 190 grams that are used to measure atmospheric parameters through the stratosphere. Typical atmospheric science experiments include understanding gravity waves, planetary boundary layer changes, and weather patterns. Engineering balloon platforms are capable of lifting up to 12 pounds of student built payloads into the stratosphere. Typical engineering platform experiments include atmospheric measurements, imaging, cosmic radiation measurements, and space technology proofs of concept.NEBP includes development and implementation of two learner-centered activity tracks 2013 engineering and atmospheric science. At sites along the eclipse path, student teams in the engineering track will use innovative larger balloon systems to live stream video to the NASA eclipse website, observe in situ perturbations in atmospheric phenomena, and conduct individually designed experiments. Atmospheric science track teams will make frequent observations by launching hourly radiosondes on helium-filled weather balloons. Student participants will work with atmospheric science experts throughout the project and will publish results in peer-reviewed journals. The project will fully support 55 teams. The 55 teams are divided into nine pods to facilitate effective education. NEBP will provide a learning environment that uses evidence and equity-based practices to make certain the 1,000+ participants are (and feel) supported, engaged, and valued. In addition, NEBP will provide infrastructure tools and best practices to help participating institutions build collaborations that could continue far beyond the scope of this project.NEBP is supported by NASAs Science Mission Directorate Science Activation program and by NASAs Space Grant College and Fellowship program.

Although the number of Brazilian bird enthusiasts are increasing since early-century, and many Brazilian ornithologists are marking bird individuals in many locations, ecological/ornithological projects involving public participation on a high quality bird monitoring (such as focused on bird individuals) are still scarce. When someone find such bird and do a report of this encounter to the ornithologist who banded that bird, this professional will have the chance to use this information in his scientific investigation, which may have different objectives. It is a simple and low budget monitoring approach for bird individuals.We first applied this approach in 2016, in an agricultural landscape in southeastern Brazil. In that occasion, we aimed to follow banded forest birds movements inside and outside small forest patches with the help of birdwatchers. You may find some results of this step here: 2022Alexandrino, et al. (2019). Challenges in Engaging Birdwatchers in Bird Monitoring in a Forest Patch: Lessons for Future Citizen Science Projects in Agricultural Landscapes. Citizen Science: Theory and Practice, 4(1), p.4. doi.org/10.5334/cstp.198In 2018, we used this approach to monitor a family of Red-legged Seriema (large-sized terrestrial bird) in an urbanized area. Our objective was identify why these individuals (one adult and two fledglings) were living in the urban ecosystem, an atypical environment for the species. Because citizens provided several pictures and movies of each monitored bird, we also described bird2019s behaviors, which helped us to go further in our investigation. You can check our results here:2022Alexandrino, et al. (2019). Large Terrestrial Bird Adapting Behavior in an Urbanized Zone.

The dismantlement of the SIMN, which occurred about 30 years ago, resulted in data collection being transferred to the regional level, consisting of 19 Regions and 2 Autonomous Provinces. This shift has caused difficulties in the availability of complete and homogeneous records for the whole country.Data acquired in the most recent years is typically available in digital format. Historical measurements are instead often available only in the printed version of the Hydrological Yearbooks published by the National Hydrological and Mareographic Service. In the past, few initiatives attempted to partially recover this information, but they focused on a limited number of years and/or some regions.Within the SIREN (Saving Italian hydRological mEasuremeNts) project we aim to digitize these data by crowd-sourcing the recovery of hydrological measurements from historical Hydrological Yearbooks to produce a consistent dataset. Phase 1 of the SIREN project will be devoted to recover daily discharge measurements.",

The ionosphere is responsible for long distance radio communication.  It also influences critical radio based services, such as communication satellite links and GPS navigation systems.The ionosphere is highly influenced by solar radiation.  It gains and loses charge, while forming distinct layers which move up and down in the atmosphere.  Those changes occur slowly during Earths 24 hour day.  However, during a solar eclipse, dramatic changes occur on a minute by minute basis.   Those rapid changes set the stage for experiments seeking to better understand ionospheric variation.Some experiments involve the monitoring of ham radio signals - generally two people communicating, via short wave radio, over paths far beyond their line of sight.  How far their signals travel and how many signals are present at any one time provides insight into the state of the ionosphere - for instance, its height, density and its dynamics. The Festivals of Eclipse Ionospheric Science are being held during the October 2023 and April 2024 solar eclipses to encourage hams to use their equipment just before, during and after the eclipse events.  Ham radio activity will provide researchers with a rich set of data regarding the ionospheres reaction to the rapid changes in solar radiation due to the eclipse.",

To do this, all you have to do is take photos of pollinators while they are visiting flowers, allowing scientists to link that plant species to that pollinator species. This information will be invaluable to conservation efforts of Californias unique flora and fauna. You can do this in urban and wild habitats, just specify if the plant you are looking at was planted intentionally (\"ornamental\") or not. Currently, iNaturalist only lets you identify one species per observation. For this project, you need to identify two (the plant, and the pollinator).

Obtaining this information is critical to improve conservation management of the species.In this project, started on 2020, we are using developing technology to access all marine iguana colonies. By taking aerial images of the coastline, using drones launched from boats, we are finally capable of covering the entire known distribution range of this species but also have found new colonies. This new approach will help us to estimate the population size of the marine iguanas in a short time but also collect data on co-habiting species and plastic objects sharing the space that can be analyzed by other researchers and local managers.Since covering a large area with aerial imagery represents collecting tons of data, we have developed a citizen science project to speed up the analysis. So far we have found that volunteers can identify iguanas accurately but also develop a special interest regarding conservation in this iconic Archipelago. The largest citizen science platform Zooniverse.org hosts our project and we have obtained more than 9000 volunteers participating with us.

Even though land cover is familiar to everyone on the planet, the most detailed maps of global land cover are still on the order of hundreds of meters [about 330 feet] per pixel. That means that a park in a city may be too small to show up on the global map.Scientists need detailed and regularly updated land cover maps because land cover is critical to many different processes on Earth and contributes to a community2019s vulnerability to disasters like fire, floods or landslides.Land cover changes with climate change or land use decisions. Changes in land cover matter because land cover can alter temperatures and rainfall patterns. Land cover influences the way water flows or is absorbed, potentially leading to floods or landslides. Some types of land cover absorb carbon from the atmosphere, and when subject to changes, such as a forest burned in a wildfire, result in more carbon entering the atmosphere. Improved land cover maps will provide a better baseline to study all of these factors at both global and local scales, particularly as scientists integrate improved land cover maps into global models.Land Cover: Adopt a Pixel enables you to photograph the landscape, identify the kinds of land cover you see (trees, grass, etc.), and then match your observations to satellite data. You can also share your knowledge of the land and how it has changed.Scientists can use your observations of land cover to improve global land cover maps. Global maps at high resolution are important for consistency. Some parts of the world do have high spatial resolution maps of land cover, but these maps do not exist for every place, and the maps are not always comparable.

Because they can both warm and cool the atmosphere, they are important for understanding the weather and climate of planets. On Mars, icy clouds can form high in the atmosphere (above 50 km, about 30 miles up), the \"mesosphere,\" called \"mesospheric clouds\". These clouds are interesting for several reasons. Although Mars is a dry planet, there is water vapor in the atmosphere that can form water-ice clouds. However, because the atmosphere of Mars is made up almost entirely (95%) of carbon-dioxide and it is cold, carbon-dioxide ice (think dry ice!) clouds can also form.Some important questions about these clouds:* What causes the atmosphere to get cold enough for carbon-dioxide to freeze out?* How do clouds change from day to night, or during different seasons, or in some years more than others?* What are the clouds made of?Our goal with this project is to first find and map these clouds to create a database that will help answer such questions.To do this, well be searching through data acquired by the Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). MCS is an instrument that peers at the horizon of the planet in the infrared and visible to measure temperature, water-ice, and dust content of the atmosphere on Mars.

        "descrip": "Help researchers explore the drama-filled world of red-headed woodpecker cavities and the animals that use them!Red-headed woodpeckers (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) are a charismatic, easily recognizable bird species of the Midwestern and Eastern U.S. Although they were formerly common throughout their range, they have undergone dramatic regional declines estimated at 67% since 1970. This population decline is presumably due to the loss of preferred nesting habitat in open woodlands and savanna-like grasslands that contain dead limbs and snags for nesting and roosting. And despite their conspicuous nature and former abundance, there is a a lot we still don2019t know about their biology and life history 2013 including nesting ecology, parental behavior, juvenile dispersal and survival, and migration patterns.In Minnesota, fragmented patches of red-headed woodpecker habitat exist throughout the state, and there is considerable interest and effort to preserve and restore these areas. In particular, land managers are focused on oak savannas, which are now incredibly rare ecosystems throughout the U.S. and are considered to be one of the rarest ecosystems worldwide. Efforts to support red-headed woodpeckers and other oak savanna specialist species through habitat restoration are ongoing at a number of sites, but these initiatives have been challenged by a general lack of information on the factors that make savannas desirable for this species.Fortunately, red-headed woodpeckers occur in relatively stable numbers (>100 breeding adults annually) at Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve in east central Minnesota, which provides a unique opportunity to study an apparently stable population. Building on volunteer monitoring work begun in 2008, a team of researchers led by Dr. Elena West began additional work in 2017 to address key information gaps about red-headed woodpecker ecology. In particular, this work places an emphasis on identifying the aspects of oak savanna habitat that support nest success and survival, habitat use, migration, and movement patterns. The Woodpecker Cavity Cam sub-project began in 2019 to augment this ongoing research and fill additional knowledge gaps. We are interested in further understanding red-headed woodpecker nesting ecology, with an emphasis on how adult nesting behaviors shape nest success, and how this may be impacted by nest predators and competition by other animals.Red-headed woodpeckers are important primary-cavity nesters2014they excavate holes in trees for nesting and roosting. These cavities are also a vital resource for other animals, including bats, squirrels, tree frogs, mice, and secondary cavity nesting birds, like nuthatches, blue birds, and chickadees. These secondary cavity users do not create cavities themselves, but depend on their availability for breeding and roosting. Through the Woodpecker Cavity Cam Project, we hope to gain a better understanding of the animals that use and compete for these cavities and how they use them throughout the year. To do this, we installed a series of trail cameras near red-headed woodpecker cavities to capture the behaviors and interactions of the community of animals that depend on these holes. With your help going through the videos that the cameras capture, we hope to learn lots of valuable new information!As a volunteer on this project, you will help us quickly identify which of our thousands of videos contain wildlife, which wildlife are featured, and what they are doing. Our project has three nested workflows, or series of tasks, for volunteers to contribute to. Depending on where we are in the process of collecting and uploading videos, one or more of these workflows may be active. You can see the currently active workflows by looking for the labeled buttons halfway down the main homepage. Depending on the workflow you select, you may be helping us sort out videos with wildlife from those without, identifying animals and documenting their behavior, or providing individual-level data on banded red-headed woodpeckers. Each workflow is essential to our project and to our understanding of life at woodpecker nest cavities. Volunteers2019 contributions are valuable no matter where they happen! Feel free to work in the workflow that feels the most rewarding to you, and to switch between workflows as often as you like. Make sure to leave questions and comments about things that are confusing 2013 our team is here to help, and are invested in making sure that you are able to give us the best possible data!

Unique species grow under extreme conditions within these isolated 201cislands in the sky201d which are rarely found elsewhere south of the Arctic circle. Alpine plants2019 reliance on these high-elevation environments also makes them especially vulnerable to climatic change, which can dramatically impact the area and ecological functioning of alpine communities.To understand how alpine plants are responding and adapting to their changing climate, the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) and Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) have teamed up with citizen scientists around the world to track geographic distributions and seasonal changes in these alpine species. Since 2004, AMC has been monitoring the timing of plant seasonal events like flowering and fruiting in conjunction with weather conditions. This is the study of phenology. Long term phenology data is a useful tool to quantify plant responses to climatic change and to identify which species might be most vulnerable to a shifting climate. To understand mountain phenology, researchers need a lot of data from different mountain ranges, elevations, and from many points in time. Fortunately, using herbarium records from the New York Botanical Garden, AMC researchers will be able to continue this investigation using historic records of alpine species collected during the past 200 years.This is where citizen scientists come in! Our researchers need lots of help to collect data from recently digitized herbarium records of alpine species and other mountain plants. Specifically, we need help documenting when, where, and by whom each historic plant specimen was collected from the wild. Anyone with a computer and access to the internet can participate in this project by joining our virtual expedition on the Notes from Nature crowdsourcing platform. From there, you can view images of preserved plant specimens, interpret and transcribe key details from their collection labels, and report directly to scientists at the AMC and around the world who will use your data to understand and help protect these unique alpine plants.While hiking in alpine areas, you can also provide valuable data for this project by capturing pictures of flowering species along the trail. The AMC is tracking current and future effects of climate change by gathering flowering and fruiting time data with the help of hikers with the Northeast Alpine Flower Watch project on iNaturalist (https://www.outdoors.org/conservation/climate-energy/alpine-flower-watch)",

Not including protists, bacteria or viruses, we humans share Vermont with at least 26,000 to 45,000 species, although no one knows for sure just how many.The list continues to grow as we discover new native and introduced species across the state. For example, citizen naturalists helped the Vermont Butterfly Survey (2002-2007) discover 12 new butterflies in the state, in the process creating a conservation watch list based on our newfound knowledge. We don2019t have to go far to discover new and surprising species. A new plant, never before described to science, was recently discovered in the Green Mountains.Join our growing community of citizen naturalists from around the Green Mountain State in discovering and sharing observations of Vermont life. Your observations can be turned into research-grade, citizen science data that will help us discover, track and ultimately conserve our natural heritage.",

They refer to the social and emotional environment of people, to their networks of relationships. One way or another, we are all part of it. We all need an emotional environment that provides us with love, support and support for our own well-being. Our families stand out in particular, understanding that the family includes those people with whom we share close and continuous emotional ties. Having a social and affective environment is a key element in the mental health recovery process.Why is research on mental health social support networks important?  Because people with lived experience in mental health and their families claim the importance and effectiveness of social support networks as facilitators of the processes of recovery and improvement of quality of life. Networks act as a preventive factor in situations of isolation and social exclusion. Scientific research on the role of the family and other social support networks in the recovery process is still relatively scarce, lacking evidence.",

This naturalistic real-world data can be cross-analysed by date, native culture of observer, number of cultures observing or not observing an attribute or group in a given culture,  etc., in other words who saw what, who didnt see what, and when. We are currently in need of voyagers observations on France, England, Italy, Germany, Spain and the USA. The voyagers can be from any culture, and any epoque, including the present. The fundamental idea of this database is that of an expanding, permanent collection of behavior-descriptive quotations, ideally in original language but also translated into a single language, which is currently English. The database, in Microsoft Office Access 2019 format, is freely downloadable and can be read on a free runtime program if Access is not available. New quotations (called Observations in the database protocol), sent in by volunteers in a standardized form, are vetted by the database caretaker before being added. The database body is thus a simple collection of extracts from historical and contemporary literature, in the form of one or several paragraphs in the original language accompanied by -date and place of publication-the name of the author, -his or her date of birth, birthplace and native culture, -biographical details if available, -translation into English (we need volunteer translators for this)-location of source material if available.",

Towns, cities, businesses, and individuals dump roughly 10-20 million tons of salt on roads, sidewalks, and parking lots every year depending on the weather conditions.

In 2017, a Fellow at the Izaak Walton League of America noticed a huge pile of salt left by a salt truck sitting directly next to a storm drain. That salt was headed right for the Muddy Branch, a small stream that travels through Maryland and feeds into the Potomac. He contacted the local government to try and address the problem. He quickly discovered that the world of road salt is a complicated one, and that its effects on our waterways are not well known or well studied. Inspired by the success of the Leagues Save our Streams community science program, IWLA staff launched Salt Watch to mobilize citizens and monitor chloride (salt) levels in local creeks and streams.

However, the world2019s oceans are threatened by global overfishing, illegal fishing and habitat destruction. These threats could undermine the many benefits the oceans provide us with. Governments face a challenge in managing oceans sustainably. Sharing information more transparently on how our oceans are being used is essential to keeping our oceans healthy and bringing back abundance. Global Fishing Watch can drive science and innovation, and improve decision-making about the effective management of the world2019s fisheries and oceans. It can harness the power of citizen engagement to help rebuild and maintain abundant oceans and will provide a powerful tool to show consumers where and by whom their fish are being caught. Using this free and global tool, users can see the fishing activity of over 35,000 commercial fishing vessels all over the world in near real-time. Users can track and measure near real-time and historical commercial fishing activity using heat maps; play animated vessel tracks over time; view individual vessel tracks, country fleets, exclusive economic zones, marine protected areas and other data overlays; and more. By monitoring commercial fishing activity, users can identify suspicious vessels and report them to the authorities. Together, we can help protect important ocean ecosystems, help enforcement agencies prioritize problem areas and vessels of concern, help to deter illegal fishing and reduce overfishing, and facilitate transparency and promote honesty in seafood supply chains. Note: The platform was designed so both experts and non-experts can see and measure fishing activity at a glance and track individual vessels over time.",

Reports also include information that is automatically pulled from an external API, such as wind speed and direction, UV index, sunrise and sunset times, air temperature, low/high tide times, etc. The BCRS has become a go-to for locals and tourists alike for checking the conditions at their local beach before making plans or heading out for any activities.

This app is a tool fishermen can use to provide critical data on the fish they release, such as length, depth of release, observed shark predation, and the use of barotrauma reduction tools like descending devices.

Since then, Horseshoe crabs have played a key role in coastal ecosystems: the eggs are eaten by shore birds, juveniles are food for sea turtles, and adults aerate the ocean floor through their digging activity.We believe Horseshoe crabs serve yet another important function: as substrate for many invertebrate species such as mussels, barnacles and snails. Many marine species require hard substrates to live on, and such substrates are historically rare on the predominantly sandy beaches of the Eastern US. In more recent times, docks and boats may offer new opportunities for intertidal species - but what about animals that do not like the tidal influence?

Nigeria has extensive mangrove forests in the coastal region of the Niger Delta, considered one of the most ecologically sensitive regions in the world. About 70% of the Nigerian mangrove ecosystem fall within the Niger Delta regionThe Niger Delta is located in the Atlantic coast of Southern Nigeria. The site falls under the Niger Delta wetlands region of Nigeria, Considered a global biodiversity hotspot. The mangrove swamp of Niger Delta covers an area of is considered a global biodiversity hotspot. The Niger Delta basin occupies the Gulf of Guinea continental margin in equatorial West Africa, between latitudes 300b0 and 600b0 N and longitudes 500b0 and 800b0 E.). Niger Delta mangroves together with the creeks and rivers are a major source of food and livelihood for millions of people. The Niger Delta mangroves perform all four categories of ecosystem services identified in the Millennium Ecosystem Services report: regulating, provisioning, cultural, and supporting services. These include atmospheric and climate regulation, flood and erosion control, wood and forest crops for cooking fuel, construction, and traditional medicine, nutrient cycling, and habitat for fish nurseries. This ecosystem also plays important role in climate change mitigation because of its high blue carbon sequestration potential. This is particularly important because of continuous gas flaring in Niger Delta from petroleum operations, which releases carbon dioxide among other gases into the atmosphere. Mangroves constitute important nurseries for fishes, crustaceans, sponges, algae and other invertebrates, and also acts as a sink, retaining pollutants from contaminated tidal water. Mangroves are also used as shelter and breeding grounds by mammals, shore birds, reptiles, many insects etc. Unfortunately, this unique ecosystem is on the decline and at the verge of been totally lost. Mangrove forests are affected by oil exploration/exploitation activities, some portions converted to farmlands and the trees are cut for timber, fuel, house construction and so on without restoring. Consequently, many coastal communities in the Niger Delta are losing their lives and primary livelihoods due to increased vulnerability to floods as a result of the disappearance of mangroves which usually serve as defense in times of coastal flooding. They are also now exposed to the high intensity of sunlight and heat waves as the land lay bare of trees to regulate sun rays. Therefore, there is urgent need to restore/conserve the mangroves of the Niger Delta region. This project will involve community/public education, participatory learning, restoring of degraded portions, local capacity building in conservation practices, experience sharing, data collection and policy review.          It would improve methods and technologies that support the sustainable use of biological resources, identify, promote and support suitable livelihood alternatives among key mangrove dependent.

Our informants can use their smartphones to record voices and to share the recordings with investigators. The question we are investigating is a simple one: do some languages sound aesthetically more pleasing than others to listeners from other countries? Perhaps there are some universal preferences for particular sounds or speech melody, or perhaps what languages we find beautiful is wholly determined by our own mother tongue. To find out, we first need to obtain standardized recordings of many world languages, and here is where you come in!",

Each volunteer will have a specific route they will drive at three different times of the day, once in the morning, afternoon, and evening. The volunteers will then drop off their sensors at a designated location. Volunteers should expect a full day commitment for participating in the campaign, as well as a 45-minute digital training session beforehand. If we cannot get enough volunteers to commit a full day to the campaign, we can look into splitting routes with multiple volunteers. For example, one volunteer drives a route in the morning and afternoon and another volunteer drives the same route in the evening.

Our backgrounds are in university and industry-based scientific research including medicine, mathematics and business. We are seeking ways to mathematically determine guilt based on evidence and so prevent people from being wrongfully convicted for crimes they did not commit, and you may be able to help.So far we have found that machine learning may be able to assist in reducing the number of such miscarriages of justice (https://academic.oup.com/lpr/article/19/1/43/5807887). We now need to validate our findings and we are appealing for volunteers to help with that work.Volunteers are needed to review on-line recordings of real trials and assess the evidence as if they were a member of the jury. The first trial we have chosen is Minnesota vs Derek Chauvin in the US. We chose this trial as it is a recent trial and it was televised live from start to verdict and on-line recordings are widely available on YouTube and elsewhere.     200b What2019s requiredThe Derek Chauvin trial provides a rare opportunity to assess the prosecution and defence evidence in a high profile murder trial and to see the extent to which individual interpretations of the evidence impact the results from our machine learning model. For those of you already familiar with the Derek Chauvin trial the work should take very little time (a few hours). Volunteers not yet familiar with the trial will need to spend more time as they familiarise themselves with the on-line coverage. The work does not need to be completed in one go, but can be spread over as many days as required.We would like you to do the following:    1. If you did not follow the trial in real time, then please find and view recordings of the actual trial and closing arguments. So you are sure you2019re watching the trial first-hand, please use courtroom videos from a reliable source such as Court TV (MN v. CHAUVIN (2021) https://www.courttv.com/trials/mn-v-chauvin-2021/) or Washington Post. See 2018Links to trial2019 below.    2. After or while viewing the trial, identify what you consider to be strands of evidence presented by the prosecution and defence 2013 you can choose as many strands as you think appropriate. You will be asked to describe your evidence strands in a few words to give the substance of the evidence. There are no right or wrong ways of identifying evidence strands 2013 it is simply your interpretation we are after, much like a jury member.    3. We would now like you to enter your strands of prosecution and defence evidence into our on-line model, where you will be asked a series of questions about your evidence strands. The following instructions are for using the on-line model, but if you prefer to work with an off-line WORD document, please contact us at enquiries@justicebrd.com and we can send you a WORD template and instructions.    4.  If you have not yet registered on our web site please do so, using your email address, here: https://www.justicebrd.com/showSignUp. These details will not be visible to others and you will not be identified in any publication, but referred to as a number (volunteer no. 1, say). Once registered you will be able to view the cases we used to train and test the model, and download the case narratives to get a feel for the level of detail needed to capture trial evidence.    5. Once registered you can sign in to the web site and create your Derek Chauvin case 2013 from the top menu select Cases > Create new case, read the instructions at the top, enter a name for your case, and click 2018Save new case2019.    6. You will see a list of all the cases used to train and test our machine learning model. Find your new case in the list and click the 2018Evidence2019 icon (magnifying glass) in the rightmost column to start entering your evidence.    7. First, enter your prosecution evidence, strand by strand. For each strand of your prosecution evidence click the 2018Create new strand2019 button at the top right, enter a short description for the strand, make sure 2018Prosecution2019 is selected, and answer the questions about quality and relevance, giving a brief justification for your answers. Click 2018Save new strand2019 at the bottom left to save each strand. If you make a mistake, or want to change anything, don2019t worry because you can go back and make any necessary changes at any time.    8. Second, enter your defence evidence, strand by strand. For each strand of your defence evidence click the 2018Create new strand2019 button at the top right, enter a short description for the strand, make sure 2018Defence2019 is selected,  answer the questions about quality and give a brief justification for your answer.    9. After you answer the quality questions for a defence strand, you will be asked to identify which strand(s), if any, of prosecution evidence you consider it challenges, and assess the strength of that challenge. You will be presented with a list of all the prosecution strands you have created. For each one select how strongly the defence strand challenges this prosecution strand, leaving the drop down as 20180 - ",

In the first week of March, we send out kits to participants containing seeds, plant labels, a field datasheet, and instructions for submitting data. Participants grow the three varieties from each trial side-by-side in their garden. We do not require a minimum number of plants. Participants evaluate each variety on a handful of key characteristics, including yield, flavor, earliness, appearance, and disease resistance. Data is submitted via a web platform called SeedLinked, which also allows users to upload photos, view variety profiles, analyze results, and connect with others in the trials.The performance data on the varieties is valuable in helping Seed Savers Exchange determine which varieties from the collection to make commercially available to gardeners and farmers through its annual seed catalog. Participants enjoy the opportunity to discover unique heirloom varieties that are not yet commercially available and help shape the future of the Seed Savers Exchange catalog.",

As we tune through the bands in SSB mode without squelch we assess the probability of possible openings by the hiss that comes out of the speaker.  We get discouraged by S9+ interference, but we instinctively know when it is possible to reach Europe or Asia by the sound of the static we hear. Over the years we have also experienced that lower bands work better in the dark of winter and higher bands are a lot fun during the solar maximum. 6m openings and sporadic E are more likely to occur in the summer and are very unpredictable. We have learned that DX works best either at sunrise and sunset. Now we have all this knowledge accumulated in our heads, but on the day we want to show off our station to an interested friend 2013 NOTHING, not even faint CW station!Everybody can attest to the fact that the great openings of a band always seem to happen when one has social engagements or a local interference creates unworkable conditions. Missing the one station in the Antarctic that you need to complete all continents!The biggest problem with shortwave radio is the fact that someone needs to be almost listening 24/7 to the bands to determine if there are any workable openings! Wouldn2019t it be great if we could just build a 201cSpace Weather Station201d that records local band conditions during the time we are at sleep, not home or otherwise socially engaged?

The vastness of this goal brought new needs for SOS into the spotlight - to better manage, publish, and share the water quality data collected by thousands of volunteers monitoring with SOS. This meant the League needed to take a good look at our protocols, our quality assurance and quality controls, and our training module to see how to modernize to meet volunteers where they are today. More importantly, we realized we needed to create platform where volunteers can share their data instantly, coordinate efforts, and track water quality over time.However, with a nationwide scope, the League noticed that other volunteer groups were having the same problems as SOS. We all needed to better manage, publish, and share our data. From there, the Clean Water Hub came to fruition.Sharing data between groups allows for more transparency so that we can begin filling data gaps and taking the steps needed to restore our streams to good health. Sharing data encourages more connection and collaboration between partners and organizations.

The birds and the trees are mutually dependent on one another: pinyon pines provide pinyon jays with food, and pinyon jays help pinyon pines spread their seeds. Both are facing unprecedented threats. The pinyon jay population has shrunk by an estimated 85 percent since 1967, and the remaining population is expected to experience further declines in the next 50 years. Researchers believe a major reason for the decline is habitat loss. Across public lands in the West, federal agencies are proposing large-scale destruction of pinyon and juniper forests. After machines chew up the trees, the agencies often plant non-native grasses, which are a favorite of livestock.Were looking for volunteers to help gather information about pinyon jays to inform sound management of pinyon and juniper forests in Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and elsewhere throughout the Colorado Plateau.Were using eBird to document pinyon jay sightings because it is user-friendly and volunteers data is easily accessible. Additionally, the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources currently downloads eBird data to inform their bird management strategies. The current Conservation Strategy for the pinyon jay, recommends a 500m buffer of undisturbed habitat around known breeding colonies, providing protection for both birds and the pinyon-juniper forests. Thus, if we can document where there are pinyon jays and perhaps even breeding colonies, we can advocate and hopefully prevent large-scale clear-cutting and discourage tree removal altogether in areas full of pinyon jays.",

In addition, samples are collected that are later analyzed in the laboratory for bacteria and nutrients. Visual observations such as weather conditions, algae coverage, water clarity, odors, and trash are also recorded on standardized datasheets.

People once thought that martin scouts flew North in search of suitable breeding sites and then returned South to guide their colonies back to the sites they had selected.  This is not true.  A martin 201ccolony201d is a random aggregation of unrelated birds attracted to a common breeding site.  Colony members do not travel in or function as a flock.  They arrive in Spring, and depart in late Summer, independently of each other.  Martin scouts will stay at a site if they nested there the previous year, or move on if they are migrants, resting on the way to their breeding sites.The Scout-Arrival Study documents the first arriving Purple Martins at nesting sites.  Landlords throughout the breeding range submit their first returning adult and sub-adult to the PMCA.  This information is used to track the spring migration progress of Purple Martins.This information is important to landlords who close their martin housing during early spring to keep out competing bird species.  Landlords use Scout-Arrival Data to determine the best time to open their housing for martins in their area.  Everyone is encouraged to participate in this ongoing study by sending your scout arrival dates to the PMCA.

Through EchidnaCSI we are documenting the current population distribution through our phone app, where the public take photos of echidnas when they see them and the app submits the GPS location, date and time along with the photo.Many aspects of echidna biology remains a mystery, even what they eat. We also ask the public to collect echidna scats where we investigate the molecules such as DNA and hormones within the scats to learn more about echidna biology. From DNA within the scats we can look at echidna diet, their genetic diversity and microbiome. From hormones we can identify highly stressed populations and investigate their reproduction.

The eTick.ca web platform was created in 2014, and processes pictures of ticks and associated collection data taken by the public and uploaded onto the citizen-science web platform for image-based identification by an expert. Following identification, the data is instantaneously projected onto an publicly-available interactive map. The turn-over from submission to identification is generally less than 24 hours. A pilot study validated the accuracy of image-based tick identification and the robustness of the online platform. In a context where the distribution of a number of tick species of medical relevance is rapidly changing (e.g. currently more than 40 tick species found in Canada), and numbers of Lyme disease cases keep on increasing year after year in Canada, deploying a monitoring and rapid information dissemination tool such as eTick.ca can increase public access to rapid identification resources, reduce the pressure on existing provincial surveillance programs, and standardize data collection across the country. After recently securing three years of funding from PHAC2019s Infectious Diseases and Climate Change fund, several academics, as well as provincial and federal public health representatives are collaborating to further develop and roll-out the eTick.ca platform to additional provinces. In addition to the benefits for the health of Canadians, the platform will provide valuable public data on tick populations and distribution range that could be incorporated into scientific studies.",

Participants use their personal computers to view images of plant specimens, consult maps and digital biodiversity archives, then decipher and record essential information about the geographic and historical origin of preserved plant collections2014including the collector2019s name, the date of collection, and the geographic location. All the data our participants collect is shared publicly on the NYBG Virtual Herbarium (www.nybg.org/vh), and biodiversity data aggregators including GBIF (https://www.gbif.org) and iDigBio (https://www.idigbio.org/portal/search). From there, plant scientists, ecologists, and conservation biologists use the data to describe new species, monitor environmental health, track climate change, and inform habitat conservation.Because specimens in the NYBG herbarium were made by thousands of botanists over hundreds of years, interpreting the diversity of label data you will encounter can require quite a bit of research and problem-solving along the way. To meet that challenge, our community of volunteers work together to solve challenging puzzles, share resources, and engage in lively conversation about specimens and stories they discover in the expedition forums.If you enjoy our project, and look forward to participate regularly, please email our coordinator about registering as an official NYBG Virtual Volunteer (https://www.nybg.org/about/work-with-us/volunteer/).",

Participants send in simple, weekly records of bird species that they see in their gardens. This information is either submitted on paper count forms or by using Garden BirdWatch Online. Each participant also supports the project financially through an annual contribution of 00a315 (approximately $22). In return, participants receive the quarterly color magazine, Bird Table, count forms, and access to advice on feeding and attracting garden birds.All new joiners will receive a free copy of an exclusive paperback version of the acclaimed \"Garden Birds and Wildlife\" (normally 00a314.99).",

Surfrider2019s network of 30+ volunteer-run BWTF labs measure bacteria levels at ocean and bay beaches and in freshwater sources, and compare them to the national water quality standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency to protect public health in recreational waters. The South Sound Chapter tests eight recreational beaches and public waterways in Puget Sound near Tacoma, Washington.  Surfrider volunteers collect the water samples and deliver them to the Tacoma Public Schools Science and Math Institute (SAMi), where a high school science teacher and his students analyze them in the lab and record the results.  All BWTF water quality data are posted online and available to the public at Surfrider.org. (http://www.surfrider.org/blue-water-task-force/chapter/37)The Chapter coordinates with the Tacoma-Pierce County Health Departments Swimming Beaches program and the Washington State Department of Ecologys BEACH Program to ensure that their sampling protocols align with the agency programs.  During the summer recreation season, the County Health Department monitors high-use beaches.  The Chapter2019s sampling schedule from September to May helps to extend the County2019s regular beach testing program into the colder months when recreational users such as divers and paddlers are still very active.  The chapter alerts the State and County when the BWTF program detects high bacteria levels at their sampling sites, and the County goes back out, retests, and issues swimming advisories and beach closures if the results still exceed health standards.  The program provides a great collaborative opportunity for an educational institution, Surfrider volunteers, and local health agencies to work together to provide better protection for beachgoers and water recreational enthusiasts in Tacoma.",

These days, getting people from diverse backgrounds to help us solve problems is on the rise. Several universities and private organizations around the world are tapping into the knowledge of people like you. Because this usually involves a large number of people (i.e. crowds) It is frequently referred to as crowdsourcing. This is unexpected since usually organizations rely on their internal experts to solve the problems. The key insight here is that non-expert humans can have vital input or to put it differently, they can think outside the box since they are not fixated by experience.However, we still know surprisingly little about the strategies that humans use, to learn how to solve a new problem. If we know the nature of the problem, obviously it is just about getting from A to B in a straight line. But how do people cope with not having (enough) information about where B, i.e. the goal, is?One of the most intuitive metaphors in problem-solving put forward by the pioneer of cognitive science and artificial intelligence, Simon Herbert, illuminates the issue: Simon likened problem-solving with a search through a landscape with a hidden treasure (Simon 1983). You don2019t know where the treasure is but each move gives you a bit more information and allows you to make decisions about where to move next. If it is a very easy problem you can easily skip from location to location, quickly getting better and better and making your way towards the final goal (more or less following the A-B straight line, even if you don2019t know where B is!). However, for more complex problems, this might not be the optimal strategy, because you will get ambiguous feedback. What do we mean by ambiguous feedback? There2019s an old story of three blind men and an elephant. Each of them touches a different part of the elephant and reaches wildly different conclusions: it2019s a brush, a pillar or a plow. Before you laugh, think about this: It2019s not trivial when you touch something that resembles a brush to figure out that you are dealing with the tip of the tail of an elephant!Still, despite decades of research, we lack a proper understanding of how humans go about solving problems and we could use your help.

Pensando nisso, elaboramos um projeto onde utilizamos os jovens das escolas p00fablicas para medirem as 00e1rvores que se encontram no entorno de suas escolas com o objetivo de encontrar os benef00edcios gerados por cada uma dessas 00e1rvores.                        As metas do presente projeto s00e3o: estabelecer um protocolo simples para os jovens que permitir00e1 a coleta de dados sobre as 00e1rvores urbanas localizadas no entorno de suas escolas de maneira simples e objetiva, capacitar os professores destas escolas no uso do protocolo para que estes possam ensinar os alunos sem a presen00e7a de um pesquisador respons00e1vel e avaliar ganhos de conhecimentos e percep00e700e3o nos participantes atrav00e9s do uso de question00e1rios pr00e9vios e p00f3s atividades.

Esse guia cont00e9m os objetivos do projeto, sua metodologia para a realiza00e700e3o dos c00e1lculos, os par00e2metros de classifica00e700e3o das 00e1rvores e a quantidade de benef00edcios que elas trazem para o meio ambiente de acordo com seu porte. Foi realizado um teste de aplica00e700e3o do projeto em uma escola de ensino m00e9dio (turma de EJA 2013 per00edodo noturno) com a ajuda dos alunos e professores do PIBID-Biologia da UFABC que atuam na escola.

Os alunos responderam ao question00e1rio de pr00e9 atividade e ao question00e1rio p00f3s atividade onde haviam perguntas sobre seu conhecimento pr00e9vio sobre os assuntos relacionados as 00e1rvores, sobre seus benef00edcios e malef00edcios e sua percep00e700e3o das 00e1rvores que estavam ao seu redor.                   Com a an00e1lise dos resultados dos question00e1rios conseguimos perceber uma melhora na percep00e700e3o das 00e1rvores que se encontravam no ambiente escolar.

Volunteers monitor local beaches and collect basic information for about two hours during a grunion run. Peak spawning season typically occurs from April through June. The grunion runs occur late at night, twice a month, after the highest tides associated with a full or new moon. Runs may occur on any flat, sandy beach and prefer areas without a lot of flashing light, noise and activity.Background: Grunion (Leuresthes tenuis) are restricted to a narrow distribution along coastal California and Baja. After concern that beach grooming practices were harming grunion eggs incubating beneath the surface of the sand during spawning season, the first systematic study of the impact of humans on the sandy beach habitat of grunion was conducted in 2002. The results effected significant and lasting change in beach grooming procedures in San Diego and throughout California. Additional studies continue to expand this work. Coastal municipalities, beach managers, state parks, government agencies and environmental organizations are cooperating to ensure protection of incubating grunion eggs on shore and continued conservation of this remarkable fish and its sandy beach habitat. Current Situation: After receiving reports last season not only of far fewer runs, but smaller and more inconsistent runs throughout their spawning habitat, we are considerably concerned about the species. We encourage volunteers to monitor the beaches this 2017 season during the spring and summer months in southern California. We have a list of dates and times, along with extensive information about these most charismatic fish on our website: www.Grunion.org.

        "descrip": "In astronomy the main goal of the research is not, very often, its dissemination to the public. However, its social relevance should be one a starting point. For the public, neither the understanding of the results, nor the processes that led to them, are trivial tasks. This is even more relevant when there is a large increase in scientific production. One way to address this challenge, used by research institutes, is to produce press releases, hoping that social media will echo them. Although this formula has obvious advantages, its randomness and the short-term effect, for example, leads to several limitations and tends to have limited duration and reduced impact on the public lacking awareness of astronomy. Thus, there is an urgent need to create mechanisms / strategies that quickly disseminate results of scientific innovation without discouraging, in the process, the promotion of positive attitudes towards science and the nature of science itself. However, the question is how to do this with the limited human resources and funding normally associated with outreach. To respond to these challenges CoAstro emerged: a citizen science project that aimed the idealization, implementation and evaluation of a scientific dissemination mechanism that would allow the flow of results and scientific processes between researchers and the public, through the involvement of dissemination structures (already present in research institutes) and non-scientific participants (teachers).The high scientific production in astronomy impel us to find new ways to carry out scientific dissemination of content, but also, of processes. Thus, we can promote positive attitudes towards science and the public can more easily deal with bad science, scientific fraud and fake news. In this context CoAstro: @n Astronomy Condo emerged 2013 a citizen science project that directly connected four astronomers, nine elementary school teachers, four science disseminators and one mediator. CoAstro00b4s, whose first edition lasted an academic year, scientific content and processes were appropriated and integrated by teachers in school initiatives, reaching approximately one thousand people. Teachers involvement in astronomy research took place in two sub-projects: 201cStars201d and 201cPlanets201d. In the first, teachers analyzed standard stellar spectra that allow the qualitative and quantitative composition determination of 57000 stars. In addition, they determined star luminosity using Data Release 2 from the European Space Agency 2013 ESA 2013 GAIA Mission. In the planets project the team started with the production of a planetary transit video, through the Python program. Then, teachers analyzed curves to signal the presence of potential exoplanets. In the process, the mediator was integrated: he adapted the language and created 201cguidelines for research tasks201d. He also ensured the maintenance of the collaborative work, articulating the challenges of research, dissemination and teaching. The scientific analysis of CoAstros results was achieved by implementing a qualitative research. The data were collected through questionnaires, interviews and observations. Results showed high improvements in teachers2019 substantive and processual knowledge; positive change in epistemological attitudes and beliefs towards astronomy; as well as, the increasing of the quality of teachers2019 scientific dissemination practices. Data from astronomers and disseminators, showed one main difference: science disseminators (unlike astronomers), have not changed their perception about teachers00b4 professional class, due to their participation in CoAstro. Indeed, both groups agree that the project: i) was useful (and facilitated) astronomy dissemination work; ii) it was an opportunity for teachers to increase their procedural knowledge about astronomy; iii) was, at the outset, risky, because of its idea of involving teachers in real astronomy research; iv) reinforced their own perception about the importance and purposes of dissemination practices, promoting new communication skills and new ways of structuring astronomy dissemination activities. Although with some implementation difficulties (time, adequacy of tasks ) CoAstro allowed us to understand how a citizen science project can contribute, with lasting and wide-public-ranging effects, to open the school to the surrounding community and vice-versa and how the public can open up to astronomy research and the latter to the public.",

Volunteers have completed almost 80,000 census counts at 1200 locations in 47 U.S. states, with additional counts from Central and South America.The information gathered through the ISS has proven pivotal to shorebird conservation planning in the United States. The U.S. Shorebird Conservation Plan draws heavily on our information in setting regional and national priorities, and ISS data have also been extensively used to document major shorebird migration staging areas throughout the Western Hemisphere and to identify and process site nominations for the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network.",

We are also exploring new ways for people to be connected while protecting their privacy. We hope to reach people with all kinds of different ideas, beliefs, and experiences, and who might be willing to report on sexual behaviors, regardless of who is involved and where it is observed. By using Kinsey Reporter, you contribute to research on human sexual behavior. We ask you to act ethically, in the role of a good journalist or \"citizen scientist.\" Submit what is true and accurate to the best of your ability.Ideally, you would submit a report within 24 hours of the event you are reporting. The report can be about yourself or someone else. It is all anonymous. Kinsey Reporter includes surveys about various sexual activities and other intimate behaviors. These surveys cover sexual behaviors and events, sexual health issues, violence reports, public displays of affection, and other unique behaviors and experience. A survey in this case is a report of information shared by many individuals on a topic of interest; it is not based on a random or representative sample of a community or population.To ensure that reported data is strictly anonymous, you can only select among the provided tags when answering a question. However, contact us to suggest new surveys, questions, or tags. To protect the anonymity of the reports even in sparsely populated areas, we aggregate reports over time. A report is not published until a sufficient number of reports have been received from the same location, and then all of those reports are recorded with a randomized timestamp. The more sparsely populated your area and/or the higher the geographic resolution you select, the longer the delay until your report appears. Therefore, in a sparsely populated area, you might want to select a lower resolution (e.g., state/region or country), to minimize the delay until your report becomes public. Interactive visualizations of the data are available on the KinseyReporter.org website.

Building off of the success of the Herring Monitoring Program, in which eighty trained citizen scientists document the herring migration at the Upper Mystic Lake Dam each spring, the Mystic River Watershed Association uses technology to broadcast and learn more about the herring migration.The first step was to install an underwater video camera at the DCR Upper Mystic Lake dam in Medford, which required the design, building and implementation of the structure to house the camera and funnel the fish within range of the camera.The camera is triggered by motion and set to record for no more than 60 seconds at a time. Short videos are then sent to the cloud and rerouted to this website, where users can play the role of citizen scientist and record how many individual herring they see in each video.Additionally, Mystic River Watershed Association staff is partnering with K-12 schools to provide hands-on science surrounding this major wildlife migration. During the first year of the project the Mystic River Watershed Association is working with classrooms in Medford, Melrose, East Boston, Somerville, Wakefield and Winchester. Teachers will develop related curriculum to be shared via the teacher resource page - downloadable for teachers anywhere to implement. Students will perform herring counts, develop critical thinking skills, improve environmental literacy, and participate in stewardship opportunities through both classroom engagement and field trips to the fish ladder.",

Participants work with marine biologist and head of Reef Ecologic, Dr. Adam Smith, in the removal of invasive macroalgae known as Sargassum from predetermined areas of the island2019s fringing coral reefs.

Today they2019re rarely seen outside of the Gulf of Carpentaria, NT and the Kimberley.Sawfish can grow to six metres with saws as long as two metres. The saw can detect the electrical impulses of fish. Then with one slash it can cut smaller fish in half. It2019s so streamlined that many prey fish may not detect it. But the saw gets caught in nets, and in the past it was a prized fishing trophy. 201cToday it2019s rare to see large sawfish,201d says Barbara. 201cMost reports are three metres or smaller. But we could be wrong. There may still be some big ones out there.201d201cFor four out of five species, the waters of Northern Australia may contain their last populations. As sawfish are slowly retreating to remote parts of the continent it2019s critical that we find out what2019s out there, and how we can help them,201d says Barbara. Barbara is leading an investigation in Queensland to identify where sawfish still occur and in what numbers. 201cWe2019re working with local Indigenous Ranger groups, fishers, and landowners, and with scientists from around the world. 201cBut to make a real difference we2019re now calling for wider public participation. Through this citizen science initiative you can make the difference to sawfish survival.201d",

SealSpotter harnesses the drone (RPA 2013 Remote Piloted Aircraft) technology we are currently using to monitor several colonies of Australian fur seals on Victoria2019s offshore islands. The high resolution images captured by the drone are then uploaded to the SealSpotter portal, ready for counting. Each image is randomly assigned and will be counted multiple times by different participants. We use the average count of each image to determine the number of seals. A video is provided before you start to explain the project and show you how to engage with the portal.  The fur seal monitoring program includes the 201cAnnual SealSpotter Challenge201d that concentrates prioritised surveys of Australian fur seal colonies into a two week super effort of counting. After the challenge has finished we load up additional surveys that can be counted by keen Citizen Scientists throughout the year.  This method of monitoring the fur seal population has replaced the traditional methods of counting the seals at the location. It provides greater precision and less disturbance and is therefore a better way of understanding the changes in population size over time. Australian fur seals are top predators, but unlike many marine predators, they come ashore to rest and breed, where we can monitor them. Some of Victoria2019s fur seal colonies can number in the tens of thousands, so the contribution made by Citizen Scientists who can count the various populations accurately and efficiently through SealSpotter is highly valued. Participants help count seals, identify pups, and also spot entangled seals caught up in marine debris such as rubbish and fishing material. In 2018 we proved that Citizen Scientists can successfully perform the counts when compared to experts and two scientific papers have been published using the data.We are excited not only about the collection of data, but also about some of the other benefits this type of accessible research collaboration brings. By engaging with a wide range of Citizen Scientists including individuals, schools and special interest groups, we are hoping that there will be an ever increasing awareness within the community of the need to support research to better understand our natural world and improve conservation and the health of our oceans. We also hope that our collaborators (you) enjoy the experience and the birds-eye view of fur seals that are difficult to observe in wild breeding colonies.We enjoy sharing the results through our social media and newsletters, and celebrating the Citizen Scientists that have contributed - particularly those that have made a large effort towards the count.

Sightings are then verified by kelp scientists and over time this 2018citizen science2019 data will help to create a map of the remaining giant underwater forests. This will then allow scientists to 1) locate and study the remnant giant kelp, 2) identify patches that might harbour warm water-tolerant kelp, and 3) locate areas that might be suitable for habitat restoration.Dense giant kelp forests were previously a conspicuous and iconic feature of the Tasmanian coast, but the loss of 95% of these giant underwater forests over the past several decades has seen them nationally listed as an endangered marine community. The decline of giant kelp forests in eastern Tasmania is associated with increased influence of warm and nutrient-poor East Australian Current water.Despite widespread loss of giant kelp forests in Tasmania, scattered individuals and patches of giant kelp still remain, but there are few records of the locations of these remaining giants. This lack of data makes it difficult to sample the remaining forests, and also makes it challenging to track their decline or growth over time.By harnessing local knowledge and observations from fishers and other waterway users in Tasmania (and also Victoria and South Australia where some giant kelp also still remains) this app will generate data to start mapping the distribution and health of these endangered underwater giants.",

This program is a part of a wider turtle monitoring project encompassing nesting rookeries from Shark Bay in the south, up to the Kimberly.The Hedland turtle monitoring program operates from October to March each year in correlation with the annual flatback migration to the coastline for the nesting and hatchling seasons (Nesting season: October 2013 January. Hatchling season: December 2013 March).The turtle monitoring program has two key goals:1. To educate and bring awareness of the local flatback turtle species and encourage positive methods for human interaction with the species. 2. To collect data concerning flatback turtle activity at the Cemetery Beach and Pretty Pool Beach nesting sites that will be used to provide an indication of the nesting and hatchling populations at Hedland; as well as to best guide management plans for the area.The program uses a non-invasive approach to obtain monitoring data through conducting early morning beach patrols assessing turtle tracks and sand patterns.

Tokay gecko is widespread in the Indo-Malayan region from northeast India and Bangladesh to southern China, and throughout Southeast Asia. It has been introduced to parts of the United States of America, the West Indies and Madagascar and probably to Brazil.Tokay geckos have become a subject of illegal wildlife trade for traditional medicine purposes. Although the geckos curative powers have been dismissed as an urban legend in parts of Asia, still more than one million geckos is estimated to be traded annually. As a result,  CITES committee recently decided to include Tokay Geckos in Appendix II, thus population monitoring is more important than ever.

The Wyss Institute and Harvard Personal Genome Project (PGP), announced their research partnership with Lumos Labs in an effort to study genomes correlated with extraordinary brain phenotypes. The Harvard PGP is an open science research project stemming from PersonalGenomes.org initiative founded in 2005 by George Church, PhD, Professor at Harvard and MIT and founding member of the Wyss Institute. It aims to collect genetic, environmental and trait data from consenting participants and make them publicly available to researchers in order to comprehensively study human health and disease. Lumos Labs are the creators of the online brain training games marketed by the public company Lumosity, which launched in 2007 and has an extensive world membership numbering upwards of 70,000,000 participants. The IdeaLead researchers Rigel Chan, PhD and Elaine Lim, PhD, both members of the Church lab and Wyss Institute, were interested in studying the genes and molecular mechanisms involved in memory and reaction speed. Understanding why some extraordinary individuals have extremely good memory and reaction speed can help us understand more about brain diseases such as Alzheimer2019s disease and other dementias. Their ongoing work focuses on studying 201cminiature brain models201d or brain organoids, and how they differ between healthy individuals and patients. 201cThis is an attempt to get people who have interesting memory and reaction speed traits and engage them in the PGP201d says Church. Previous work using genome wide associated studies (GWAS) on large cohorts of healthy individuals and patients have not been very successful in identifying key genes and biological mechanisms responsible for enhanced memory and reaction speed, and Church thinks a paradigm shift is needed: 201cWe need to connect the dots between organ and trait. What we want is something testable; we need to see emergent behavior at the molecular and organ level201d. The PGP has the established infrastructure for enrolling participants in these studies, but Chan and Lim were looking to team up with the right partner. 201cWe wanted a set of online assessments that can be fun and easily accessible to the participants, and Lumosity provided the right combination of games that are fun yet challenging201d said Chan. Lumos Labs are also interested in the scientific development and assessment of their platform and frequently collaborate and publish findings of their research partnerships in peer-reviewed journals.  The AssessmentThe participants are asked to complete six tests aimed to assess their memory, attention and recall speed. These games include recollecting a series of blinking objects, associating symbols with digits, recognizing objects seen before versus novel items, reaction speed to an object seen before and counting simple colored geometric shapes appearing in succession. The scientists will analyze participant scores and identify high performers. 201cWhat we are measuring is memory and reaction speed because of interesting disease relevance to disorders such as Alzheimer2019s disease201d said Lim. Individuals resilient for these traits are highly encouraged to sign up. 201cWe are using the Lumosity games because of the broader outreach to everyone, and not just a small elite group201d as she explained their team2019s preference for games over other assessments such as survey forms or standardized admission tests. How To EnrollThe PGP registry has over 5000 people who have already consented to make their data, genomes and biomaterials publicly available, and who are eligible for the PGP-Lumosity collaboration and other third-party research studies. Enrollment in the PGP is open to anyone who is a citizen or resident of the United States, at least 18 years of age and consents to sharing genetic, health and trait data in a public manner, in line with the open-science philosophy of the program. After signing up with the PGP, anyone can participate in the PGP-Lumosity research study, and the study will require some basic information such as age and gender, which are needed for analyzing the scores obtained. The participants are kept anonymous and only aggregate summary results will be published from the PGP-Lumosity study. However, participants have the option of sharing personal information such as their Lumosity scores back to the PGP. PGP participants are also free to opt out of the program at any time and eschew future contact about the collection of personal information and biological material. The researchers emphasize that enrollment in these studies stems from other reasons beyond the argument on the beneficence to society, such as curiosity, benefits to immediate family members or downsides and disadvantages that can be realized early. This open platform can also excite and embolden PGP members to be directly involved with the science and scientists of the PGP and their collaborators. 201cIf you are exceptional in any way, you have an obligation to share it not hoard it201d concluded Church.

We are interested in talking to folks like yourselves from a variety of backgrounds, to get ideas ideas for future iterations of the project!Why look for these little brown birds by song? Eastern bristlebirds are masterful at avoiding detection as they weave between clumps of tussock grasses that cover the ground of their heath woodland habits along the east coast of Australia. This makes these shy birds challenging for ecologists to find during traditional bird surveys. We do know, however, that relative to the past, the number of these furtive birds has dramatically declined, particularly in their northern most reach in Queensland. While a few reasons are suspected for their decline, further study is needed to understand how to save remaining birds. Eastern bristlebirds are a good candidate species for acoustic sensing (trying to capture sounds of animals in acoustic recordings), because they are quite territorial, having 2018song battles2019 with nearby rival males during breeding season. Armed with this knowledge, a dedicated team of people set out to deployed acoustic sensors just before breeding season, and left the scene hoping the birds would sing soon after human intruders left! Now, there are WAY too many recordings for a small team of ecologists to go through alone, but if we all listen to recordings together and better understand where the birds are living.

Every manta ray has a unique spot pattern on their belly, that can be used to identify them over their lifetime. Any diver or snorkeler with a camera can take and upload a manta identification photo. Researchers can also upload and organize individually identified manta rays in the regional populations they are managing. MantaMatcher also promotes collaborations by way of cross-referencing different study sites. Scientists can now examine if populations are shared between neighboring countries, examine regional and long distance movements, and examine the lifespans of manta rays.",

The application saves each sighting with location and other data, and sightings are logged in the user2019s online WildLab account. Files based on a users sightings can be easily loaded into Cornell Lab of Ornithologys eBird database.In a pilot program developed with funding from the MacArthur Foundation, more than 500 New York City 5th- through 12th-grade students used iPhones to log thousands of bird sightings from nearby parks and green spaces. Participants in the project increased their knowledge as well as their interest in science careers. All educators involved in the project said they would participate again if it was offered in the future.The WildLab has also piloted a program with the Cornell Cooperative Extension for horseshoe crab monitoring; this app will be available soon in the app store.

The OADA is open to anyone interested in building open standards data transfer tools in agriculture, including: existing agriculture organizations, farmers, software engineers, academics, and private companies. There is no cost to participate. The application of data science in modern production agriculture has the potential to improve crop yields and use natural resources more efficiently by enabling farmers to evaluate past, current and future farm management decisions through the analysis of agronomic data generated in the field. However, a significant barrier to the adoption of these new technologies is the incompatibility of data formats between platforms and inconsistent approaches to data security and privacy. Farmers deserve a clear understanding of the security and privacy standards service providers follow in the use and management of the farmer2019s data. To that end, the OADA will develop protocols and will create security and privacy working groups that collaborate with other stakeholders to ensure farmer peace of mind regarding the protection and use of their data across a broad range of business policies and practices. The open standards of OADA will give farmers the flexibility and control they need to choose data science products and services that will work on their farms to help manage their data and make more data-driven decisions, enabling the next wave of agricultural production.201d",

It2019s really just one supply called a dendrometer, and it does most of the work.So if you have a red maple (Acer rubrum) in your yard, and a few minutes of free time per year we would like your help in monitoring the growth of your tree.The objectives of the project are to understand how climate and urbanization affect tree growth and health, and thus ecological services like carbon sequestration and air and water filtration. Despite the importance of mature trees, there is a lack of experiments to measure the effects of warming on tree growth and services. Urban areas are warmer and often have higher CO2 concentrations than their rural counterparts. This means urban trees may grow faster or slower than rural trees, but it also means we can use urban warming as a surrogate for global warming. Cities may be sentinels that predict how plants and animals respond to climate change.Our goal is to measure adult tree growth in urban, suburban, and rural areas with the help of volunteer citizen scientists. We will provide the citizen scientists with a dendrometer, a tool that measures tree trunk growth without injuring the tree (it will need to remain on the tree for at least a year, hopefully longer). We will ask citizen scientists to report tree growth and a few other details about their tree periodically. In return, participants will learn about how their tree compares to others across the country.Although this seems very simple, it provides valuable data to determine how different altitudes, latitudes, and urban conditions affect tree growth and carbon sequestration. Ultimately, we plan to have citizens measuring thousands of trees across the country.",

Stream monitoring is a tool for assessing the health of the Susquehanna and Potomac watersheds and determining the effectiveness of the pollution reduction efforts. To this end, ALLARM developed a protocol for chemical and biological stream monitoring to collect baseline data on key Bay tributaries.By collecting water quality data volunteers will be contributing to a dataset used for community decision making and local purposes, as well as contribute to regional data collection efforts facilitated by the Chesapeake Bay Cooperative. Not only will these data contribute to a better understanding of the health of the Bay2019s tributaries, but they will also help volunteers better understand the health of their waterways and will equip them with the tools necessary to use science as an agent for change.Participants will be trained by ALLARM staff on how to use the equipment to collect data on nitrate-nitrogen, conductivity, pH, and temperature. Participants will also be trained to collect and analyze macroinvertebrate data annually. ALLARM requests that volunteers commit to at least one year of monthly monitoring and that they submit quality control samples twice a year. Quality control is an important credibility tool to verify that volunteers are using their equipment correctly and that the equipment is working properly. Participants will be expected to enter their data into the regional database, the Chesapeake Data Explorer.",

To do this we need help collecting this butterfly from across its entire range, including your backyard! The small cabbage white butterfly is a great species to study how organisms adapt to new environments because it has invaded many parts of the world. It is also probably the most abundant butterfly on the planet, largely due to it being an agricultural pest--the caterpillars feed on plants in the mustard family (broccoli, cabbage, kale, etc.).  Therefore, collecting a few wont harm this species, yet these collections will allow us to answer many important questions that would not be possible otherwise. Thus this species is the perfect ambassador for learning about other butterflies and insects. Please consider helping this important effort, because through your collections of this butterfly we can learn a great deal about the ecology and evolution of butterflies more broadly as well as how human activities (climate change, pollution, etc.) are having an effect on biodiversity.",

For this we count on the help of the public to submit reports of sick or dead wildlife and to submit samples for analysis.Wildlife diseases can cause population declines and even local species extinctions. They are a welfare concern (especially if they are caused, or exacerbated, by human activities) and some wildlife diseases can impact public health. It is important, therefore, that we monitor trends in wildlife diseases to identify their impact, underlying causes and to identify new and emerging threats. Every report submitted by the public contributes to a national database of wildlife disease incidents. Every sample submitted is examined and then archived into one of the largest wildlife tissue banks in the world. These are invaluable resources that provide a solid grounding to study and safeguard the health of British wildlife. We also create reports that inform government and NGO policies on conservation management and we liaise with the relevant agencies when a possible domestic animal or human health threat from wildlife is identified.Aims of GWH:- To monitor trends and investigate emerging threats to garden wildlife health.- To raise public awareness of disease threats to garden wildlife.- To promote best practice for activities that involve garden wildlife to help safeguard their health.- To communicate outcomes to the public, scientific communities and government agencies to prioritise    actions to enhance the environment and biodiversity, public and domestic animal health.- To provide a database and wildlife tissue archive for collaborative research.",

Although the conservation of Elasmobranchs is gaining rising public concern, smaller sharks and rays are often in the shadow of widely adulated charismatic sharks. Several species of catsharks, rays and skates - many of which are endemic to Southern Africa - make up a large portion of the bycatch in South African commercial fisheries. Many Elasmobranchs are also targeted directly for products like shark cartilage, liver oil, leather, teeth, jaws as well as ray wings and shark fins.  Monitoring Elasmobranch populations can be difficult and costly. There are however, a number of people, who encounter sharks, skates and rays on a regular basis: Anglers, divers, snorkellers, skippers, the occasional beach visitor and basically anyone, who reads the news or surfs the internet. And they can deliver two different types of data:   1) EGGCASES Some sharks and all skates lay leathery eggcases either directly into the sand or they attach them to tough underwater surfaces such as rocks, corals or kelp. Storms, currents or predators can loosen these eggcases and wash them ashore. These mermaids purses have characteristic shapes that differ in each species and their abundance and distributions can be used for long-term monitorings. 2) SIGHTINGS. People who spend time in or close to the water regularly encounter sharks, skates or rays. These direct observations can help with the identification of species-distributions and important habitats. Sightings do not always have to be recorded first-hand, but can be extracted from photographs or news articles. Historic photographs are of specifically high value as they can be an indication of changes in size and abundance of species.   ELMO serves as an interactive database that can be accessed and utilized by everyone. All data is illustrated in an interactive map that can be used to explore our Elasmobranch populations. Furthermore we administer the original information in datasheets, which can be obtained directly from us for projects that promote Elasmobranch conservation and awareness campaigns. We are working closely together with other citizen science projects and data bases to make sure your contributions reach out as far as possible. We also provide a number of resources, which can be used privately or for educational purposes.

Lets make a difference!Children are one of the largest consumers of technology.Children, adolescents, kids, youths, young people, call them what you like, they have all grown up using technology so readily, it2019s almost an extension of the body. Children can be classed as 2018digital natives2019. We live in an attention economy with so much information being processed and ignored on a daily basis that the quickest way to absorb this is digitally.On 5th August, 2010, the then CEO of Google, Eric Schmidt, stated that every 2 days we create as much information as we did in the time period between the dawn of civilisation up to 2003. He stated this was around five exabytes of data, every 2 days.This digital environment has led to an increase in the amount of time that children spend using digital screens and other forms of technology. Some schools even require their students to submit homework via digital devices, some issuing iPads and tablets for that very purpose. This increase in screen time is all part of modern education.The portability of technology coupled with the drive for more compact devices that have multi-functions, has led to a dramatic rise in the use of mobile phone technology amongst adolescents.The technology that we have today, being of a 24-hour nature, has brought the entire world closer together, enabled communication and provides information on-tap at a moment2019s notice. This has created a societal addiction to information and the need to remain constantly connected to one another.Alongside this rise in the use of technology during bedtimes, is the problem that adolescents get fewer hours of sleep during weekdays and this affects their abilities during the daytimes both inside and outside the school setting.Some studies have shown that a reduction in sleep or sleep disturbance has other consequences including long-term health affects to motor development, weight gain, cognitive functioning, increased addictions to caffeine and nicotine and even suggestions of cancer growth.Although the various mechanisms that affect circadian rhythms have remained similar throughout history, it2019s only in recent times that technology has started to play its part and the things that accentuate these mechanisms are related to what we term, 2018zeitgeist.2019 The Oxford English Dictionary defines zeitgeist as, 201c2026the general mood or quality of a particular period of history, as shown by the ideas, beliefs, etc. common at the time.201d These are things like societal, cultural, technological and general lifestyle trends that occur within each era.There is already a wealth of research covering different age demographics and some indicating a causal link between night time technology use and daytime sleepiness. These studies aren2019t confined to the UK. Research has been undertaken in many countries around the world.The aim of this citizen science project is to build upon the original research study and to see whether it can be established through empirical study of a statistically significant-sized data sample, that bedtime technology has an affect on circadian rhythms in adolescents all around the world and not just in the UK.

Since the first launch of the app on Google Play, the Observers App has provided an excellent tool for out-reach, awareness and monitoring of protected species, particularly the humpback whale (Megaptera novaengliae), the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) and the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncates).O.R.C.Ireland is a non-profit organisation based in University College Cork that is dedicated to monitoring ad minimising disturbance to marine wildlife, ran by student volunteers and directed by marine scientists in collaboration with the public, eco-tour operators, and maritime industry all around the country.The Observers App was conceptualised by O.R.C.Ireland founder Emer Keaveney in 2017 having spent a considerable amount of time scanning the oceans surface in the hopes of getting an observation of a humpback whale and went to look for a dedicated marine megafauna recording app  across the various app stores to help track their movements - with  available it was only logical to develop one that could provide an easy and accurate way of recording marine biodiversity. With the power of mobile phone technology, the Observers App allows access to recording of animals in even the most remotest of areas - easily used by locals and even fishermen at sea to record sightings and strandings. The app is still in its early stages but is already able to provide information on who is seeing what, where and when and allow us to share our observations with like-minded people. It also doubles as a free educational resource, has an 201cObservers Tool-kit201d and makes citizen science fun and easy - with a handy recording tool right in your pocket.These data can then be used to manage important areas for protected species like whales, dolphins, seals and seabirds and to create a conservation plan for marine megafauna in Irish waters. Data on temporal and spatial trends is shared with the National Biodiversity Data Centre and can be viewed by anyone and downloaded on request- contact: observers.app@gmail.com for more information. Personal data is never shared with third parties and full credit is always given for the media uploaded to the app",

Unlike the noisy miner, bell miners prefer a thick understorey of any plant species for nesting.

However, as this species is opportunistic and will nest in exotic plant species such as Lantana camara, it is now thought that its presence is a symptom of dieback and forest disturbance where an increase of their food source, namely herbivorous insects, has occurred. Little is known, however, about how or why a bell miner colony chooses a particular site for colonisation and whether they claim a site after insect numbers have increased and the trees are already showing signs of stress long before tree death occurs. In order to determine this, we need more information on the location of colonies, their habitat in terms of understorey plants and any information on how long a colony has been in the area. Therefore, a project has been started for everyone to report the location of colonies and other information that can be provided.",

The components of MO DIRT are: 1. A state-wide soil health survey. Monthly soil health surveys are conducted by volunteer citizens measuring physical, chemical and biological characteristics of soils at test sites. Currently, there are 53 test sites with the participation of more than 600 citizens. Test sites include forest, prairie, grassland, pasture and cropland habitats.2. New grade K-12 soil science curricula. A manual with hands-on activities on physical properties of the soil is available for elementary and middle school students.3. Mentoring of high school scientists. Research profiling microbial communities in Menfro soil from till and no-till croplands was conducted by a high school student. 4. Public enrichment in soil science. Hands-on soil activities have been offered at agricultural education days at MU Research Stations, Earth Day events, Boy Scout camps, the Saint Louis Science Center, Master Naturalist2019s advanced training, and teacher2019s professional development workshops. Over 3,000 Missourians have benefited from MO DIRT since August 2014, with the collaboration of more than 35 institutions. A website (modirt.missouriepscor.org) offers access to educational and training materials and the data collection portal of the soil health surveys.",

Citizen Scientists attend a one-day classroom and field based education program, where they learn about species identification, behavior, management concerns, and how to observe and document loons. They also learn how to use field equipment such as spotting scopes, compasses, and GPS receivers. Hiking distances to the sites range from along the roadside up to fifteen miles. Once they reach the lake, Citizen Scientists observe for one hour and document loon sightings and behavior. Common Loons are a Montana Species of Special Concern, and Glacier National Park harbors about 20 percent of Montana2019s breeding pairs. Loons are susceptible to adverse impacts by human disturbance at nest and nursery sites. The Common Loon Citizen Science Project helps to identify factors that affect nesting success. The contribution of citizen scientists to the long-term record of loon population health is invaluable in providing a scientific basis for management recommendations, especially in regards to issues that may affect loon nesting success and habitat.",

Bumble Bees are considered keystone species because they play a critical role in the ecosystem: they are pollinators, necessary not only for native wildflower reproduction, but also for creating seeds and fruits that feed wildlife as diverse as songbirds and grizzly bears. If the bees are lost then the effects would be felt all the way through the food chain. The Rusty Patched Bumble is the first Bumble Bee species to emerge in the Spring and the last species to go into hibernation in the Fall. Thus, the species is active from April - September. Because this species emerges so early, they generally     inhabit woodlands and woodland edges so that they have a constant supply of nectar from the  early woodland wildflowers such as Dutchman2019s Breeches and Wild Columbine.The first step in the conservation of a species is to know where it exists. This species is threatened by many factors including habitat loss and degradation, disease, pesticides, and climate change, but at the present, the most important action we can take for the Rusty Patched Bumble Bee is to simply find it. This species hasn2019t been seen in the Southern Appalachians for a very long time, but we2019re not ready to write it off yet. With your help we will re-discover this species in our area leading to protection of its critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act. That is why Wild South is calling on you to help us find them once again! Search your yards, the trails you hike, and the greenways you walk and contribute to scientific discovery!This citizen science project is calling on all of you hikers and wildflower hunters out there to take up the cause and photograph all of the Bumble Bees you come across.

Let2019s put those lenses to good use and work together to help save rare Bumble Bee species from extinction!

Right now, everyone is on their own journey, communicating only bits and pieces of it in small posts here and there, which quickly disappear in the noise.Data aggregation for autoimmune diseases has never been done at this scale and we2019re excited to provide a resource to facilitate that. Users will record symptoms, treatments, and results using the Autoimmune Citizen Science mobile application.

Clearing for settlement and agriculture has led to the loss of over 80% Macadamia habitat and the trees themselves; though in many areas, the delicious nut provided by some Macadamia species meant they were left standing while the forest around them was cleared. Early conservation efforts in the late 1800s, also led to the planting of nuts from wild trees in backyards across south east Queensland, north east New South Wales and further afield. Understanding the genetic composition of wild trees - both where they naturally occur (in-situ) and where they have been transplanted (ex-situ) is important for conservation and the future of the macadamia industry (which was founded on very few trees and has limited genetic diversity).

These organisms have adapted and acclimatised  to temperate (cold water) conditions. However, climate change modelling predicts that Australia2019s surrounding oceans will warm by 120132 2070C by 2070, with the south east coast of Australia expected to feel the greatest effects due to increased strength and penetration of the East Australian Current (EAC).  2013 the EAC pushes warm water from the tropics, i.e. around the Great Barrier Reef, southward into the temperate waters found along the south eastern coast. This strength varies in season2013As a consequence to this predicted increase in ocean temperatures, there is mounting evidence suggesting that the geographic range of tropical and temperature coastal fish species will shift to higher latitudes (in this case further South), in response to warming trends.  For example, ongoing studies around a coastal town called Merimbula (3700b0S) have recorded over 50 species of tropical fish which are aided by the warmer water and stronger EAC during Summer/Autumn. It is only when the warm water recedes and cold water replaces it, do these tropical fish die.  With the predicted changes, these tropical fish are expected to survive through winter and compete with temperate fish species.In addition to this, structurally important and unique macroalgae (e.g. bull kelp Durvillea potatorum) are predicted to have dramatic temperate fish range shifts. Preferring temperate conditions, increased ocean temperatures are predicted to radically move macroalgae distribution poleward. Warm ocean temperatures influence the health of macroalgae, often leaving large populations vulnerable to disease and wave action. Macroalgae provides important habitats for a number of temperate fish and invertebrate species throughout their life cycles, with predicted poleward shifts, species  that require macroalgae habitats will either adapt or follow macroalgae range shifts.Acknowledging these predicted changes, community members are establishing a long term monitoring program to record any annual and seasonal changes in fish diversity and macroalgae health.  This would also include recording sea surface temperature.Acknowledging these predicted changes, community members are establishing a long term monitoring program to record any annual and seasonal changes in species diversity and macroalgae health.

Similar programs soon sprung up in SA and WA and grew steadily over the years, supported by volunteers in each state. Now, every year, hundreds of people gather information from more than 3500 mounds. At the 2004 Malleefowl forum in Mildura it was decided that all this information needed to be gathered into the one placea national database.We needed to ensure that all of the data going into the database was collected and recorded in the same way so a set of guidelines were written (the National Malleefowl Monitoring Manual) and are available in the Library section of our website.With the growth of the digital age, we have seen vast improvements with data collection (using Palms and then GPS PDA2019s and now smartphones), gathering of digital images of each mound, and the growth of the data base into an incredibly useful tool that also allows volunteers to see the outcome of their combined efforts. All volunteers can get access to the site. Of particular interest is the file of all past photos of the mounds. Each year another photo is added for each mound, resulting in a slide show of the many stages a mound can go through. The database is also an incredibly powerful tool for scientists to use when analysing mound use over the years, although its main function is to track trends in Malleefowl populations.The database is a credit to all of our citizen scientists2019 efforts over the many years of data collection and makes available some very important pieces of information.

Knowing what the trends in Malleefowl populations are in different areas is not just an interesting thing to know. It immediately leads us to ask 2018why are Malleefowl doing better here than there?2019 Answering this question informs us what the species requires to survive. The annually updated information also allows managers to target certain areas where the birds seem to be struggling, and to measure how effective different management actions are.",

Volunteers sign up and borrow a passive bat-detector from one of 21 centres hosting equipment. Leaving the detector outside at three different locations a night within a 1-km square, bat calls are recorded and saved to a memory card. After three days, volunteers return the detector and post the memory card containing bat recordings to the BTO. The data are analysed using algorithms that help assign bat calls to species and volunteers are sent a report with the results of their survey within a few days of taking part. Since the start of the project in 2013, volunteers have surveyed 1,146 1-km squares (>20% of Norfolk). This has generated over 1.2 million bat recordings, making this one of the most extensive high-quality datasets for bats from anywhere in the world.At a local scale, the Norfolk project has improved our understanding of patterns of occurrence and activity of all species from the near ubiquitous Common Pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) to the locally scarce Leisler2019s bat (Nyctalus leisleri). This has demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of setting up a network of centres across a survey area of interest from which anyone can borrow a passive detector for a few days. Through our choice of centres, it has given us the opportunity to work with a wide range of communities and organisations that already had their own network of volunteers or members, and in doing so opened up citizen science to a new set of people. Plans now are underway to set up of a much larger acoustic bat project across southern Scotland, in partnership with the Bat Conservation Trust, National Trust for Scotland and funded by Scottish Natural Heritage to run from May 2016.

As such, lack of information on basic biology and ecology is one of the greatest limitations to conservation of bat species.There are three ways that you can participate in this project:1) Report sick or dead bats. With the spread of White-Nose syndrome, which can be fatal for bats, it is important that we track bat mortality.2) Monitor bat roosts during the summer. Bat roost monitoring is simple and can be an enjoyable experience. Monitors identify bat roosts and sit outside the roost entrance in the evening to count the bats as they emerge. Bats will start to exit the roost just after sunset, and will emerge one or two at a time making counting easy. The bats will continue to exit for about 40 minutes. How often a roost gets counted is up to the volunteer, however the program appreciates at least two counts- one in early June and one in late July.3) Conduct acoustic bat surveys in Wisconsin. Volunteers are trained to use handheld ultrasonic detectors, or bat detectors as they are affectionately called. The system consists of a detector that records the ultrasound, a PDA that displays the bat calls on a graph of frequency over time, and a GPS unit that tracks the route taken and pinpoints each bat call. Data is saved onto the PDA and analyzed in the office. Just like birds, bat species have different calls from each other.

By focusing on the ecological needs of Lake Mendota as well as the surounding community, the game is able to bring together real-world issues and scientific practices.Citizen Science encourages students to connect ecology content to civic action.  It is designed to introduce questions like, \"What can I do to change things?\"  The purpose of Citizen Science is to help players develop a conceptual understanding of lake ecology while giving them experiences of confronting pressing ecological issues, conducting scientific inquiry to address these issues, and taking action in the (virtual) world to affect change.Citizen Science was developed for upper-elementary school and early middle school students.

Records like this are crucial in our understanding of how the ranges of organisms change with our changing climate and landscapes.Ants are ubiquitous in Australia. They occupy every habitat and landscape across all States and Territories (excluding Antarctica). Their sensitivity to disturbances of many sorts means they can be used as bioindicators of landscape health, reforestation and mine site recovery.  They are important predators, pest controllers and soil engineers, but can also become pests themselves.Ants also move around with humans all the time, so finding out what ants are where can help us pinpoint problem ants before they cause problems for humans, our environment or agriculture in Australia.

Analyses and visualizations are authored in an open, collaborative environment which allows existing analyses and visualizations to be shared, modified, repurposed, and enhanced.Behind the scenes, SciencePipes is based on the Kepler scientific workflow software which is used by professional researchers for analysis and modeling. SciencePipes brings that scientific power to new audiences by consolidating the same workflow components used by scientists into pieces that have more intuitive meaning, and by providing components specifically targeted to these audiences.Because SciencePipes provides tools for original data analyses rather than visualizations of predetermined analyses, it empowers users to develop new and valuable results. Those results can be exposed as dynamic web resources, in web contexts unrelated this site. Finally, because of the generality of the Kepler scientific system upon which this site is built, this online system can be extended to science and engineering disciplines beyond the environmental sciences.",

Butterflies are unique indicators of the state of the environment because of their rapid lifecycles and high sensitivity to environmental conditions. The volunteer networks and datasets created by this project enable accurate assessment of butterfly trends, allowing researchers to assess the impacts of climate change.This pioneering study aims to get a representative picture of the status of butterflies in widespreadhabitats such as lowland intensive farmland and upland grassland and moorland. Strong emphasis has been placed on making sure that the Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey is both scientifically sound (by using random sampling) and efficient (a scheme with fewer visits to account for the fact that butterfly species are now uncommon across much of the general countryside).This new scheme runs in parallel with United Kingdom Butterfly Monitoring Scheme, which is very effective at monitoring habitat-specialist butterflies and lowland semi-natural habitats, and the Butterflies for the New Millennium project, which acts as the main source of information on where butterflies live.",

Results of the monitoring effort are available to National Park Service managers so that they can make better management decisions based on sound, scientific information.Camas is an important cultural and natural resource. For the last 7,000 years, camas has been an important part of the Nez Perce history, life and culture, as well as those of many other tribes of the Pacific Northwest. In addition, camas is one of a suite of wetland species associated with seasonal wet prairie ecosystems. However, as a result of recent agricultural conversion, irrigation, flood control, and other land use practices, remaining wet prairies in this region have been drastically reduced. Projected climate change will also impact these wet prairie ecosystems and monitoring camas populations will provide the National Park Service an opportunity to track climate change impacts on park natural resources.Monitoring of camas and invasive weeds is a unique opportunity to integrate natural resource monitoring with the cultural history of the Nez Perce people. Citizen scientists will use carefully designed scientific procedures and modern technology to collect data, such as the number of camas plants and flowering plants and the presence of invasive species. Components of the program are tied to state science standards, and high school students will work alongside ecologists, statisticians, natural resource managers, and interpretive rangers.Three local high schools are currently participating each year.

When rainfall causes rivers to rise the small tributaries rise first and we are trying to capture that moment when the small rivers are showing just how much sediment they are contributing to the system. Why are we doing this? Eastern Hellbenders are an imperiled aquatic salamander that can grow up to 2.5 feet long and they are a treasure of the ecosystem of the Appalachian Mountains. These salamanders have seen declines of up to 80% throughout their range and much of that decline can be attributed to irresponsible land use practices along the corridors of waterways in Western North Carolina. When waterways are cleared of the vegetation along their banks, those banks can quickly start eroding and contributing excess sediment into the system. Hellbenders need a specific type of habitat to successfully reproduce: clean, fast flowing water with large rocks and boulders. The Hellbenders use the underside of large rocks and boulders as nesting sites and when excess sediment finds its way into the system that can fill in the critical spaces under those large rocks and boulders that Hellbenders depend on.

If this happens, we2019ll ask the volunteer to send in their parasitoids and dead caterpillar so we can sequence the DNA. The DNA will help us learn about the relationships between parasitoids and their hosts. What2019s a parasitoid?Parasitoids are animals that live on or in other animals, and feed off them to survive. They are parasites, like the head lice you might have been infected with in primary school. A parasite normally doesn2019t kill their host (the animal they2019re living on) but a parasitoid does. The parasitoids we are studying are insects like flies and wasps that lay their eggs in caterpillars.Why do we want to know about caterpillars and parasitoids? Well if you like hot chips, or apples and pears, this information is important to you! Potato crops and orchards are just a couple of examples of agriculture crops that battle with caterpillars eating their plants on a daily basis. Whilst these caterpillars have an important place in our ecosystem, we don2019t want them taking over our crops. Parasitoids are an important part of solving this problem. By releasing parasitoids into their crops to reduce caterpillar numbers, farmers don2019t need to spray as many pesticides, which kill beneficial insects too. The parasitoids are what we call biological control agents2026 like the secret agents of the agriculture world.Before we can know what parasitoids might be useful, however, we need to know how they are related to each other and what caterpillars they infect 2013 that2019s where you come in! Many of the caterpillars will not have parasitoids inside them, in which case we are asking volunteers to take a photo at each stage of the life cycle and add it to a single BowerBird sighting, to build a database of images for identification purposes.",

The Shield has been awarded each year since 2012.In 2014 we expanded this concept to Lifesearch, which aimed to document the whole span of biodiversity within the Western Port Biosphere.  ",

Although protected in Australia, platypuses are currently regarded as 2018a species of least concern2019 by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. This is largely because the overall distribution of platypuses has not changed significantly since the European settlement of Australia. However, anecdotal evidence indicates there have been some localised declines and extinctions but empirical data is poor due the difficulties in conducting surveys and the lack of long-term studies on platypus populations.Understanding the occurrence and distribution of a species is essential for effective management and conservation. Local knowledge is an invaluable source of information, which is often overlooked in ecological studies. Many potentially useful observations of platypuses are made by local residents, workers, tourists, fishermen, campers, hikers/bushwalkers and general outdoor recreationists. platypusSPOT offers wildlife enthusiasts an opportunity to contribute to a community-driven database on platypus distribution, post photos and videos, view platypus sightings in your area, and interact with other 2018platypusSPOTters2019.

This is primarily due to platypus being IUCN listed in the 2018of least concern2019 category.  While a number of studies have shown the platypus to be incredibly resilient to negative shifts in environmental quality, others have indicated dramatic impacts. The fact of the matter remains that we simply do not confidently know:How much is too much? That is, what environmental factors are platypuses sensitive to, and to what degree;How few is too few? That is, the minimum acceptable population abundance to maintain genetic diversity and species persistence in the event of a major limiting event, such as disease or acute habitat toxicity; and,Location, location, location! That is, it may be that different factors are at play in different localities, and so protection for the species may need to be considered on a regional case-by-case basis.As part of a year-long undergraduate research project, University of Western Sydney student Sara Judge has been working alongside Lithgow Environment Group to try and answer some of these questions. The premise of the project is to begin building a preliminary assessment of how the various forms of extensive, long-term land-use between Wallerawang and Hartley may be impacting the local platypus population and the environmental resources upon which they depend: the benthic macro-invertebrate food source, the aquatic environment, and riparian integrity for burrow sites. The project includes two other target species: the eastern water rat and a selection of water birds. All three species groups occupy a similar habitat profile and share the same IUCN listing as 2018of least concern2019, providing some interesting grounds for comparison.It is hoped that at the conclusion of the project, the findings will assist in the direction of future monitoring and study of the Lithgow platypuses over a longer-term, providing invaluable contribution towards their management and protection.

This 2018bellyprint2019 allows researchers to track individuals over space and time and better monitor wild populations.Currently the Manta Matcher database enables researchers to upload, organize, and individually identify the manta rays in their populations. Manta Matcher was also intended to promote scientific collaboration by way of cross-referencing regional databases of manta rays to check for exchanges, learn more about their migratory patterns and life history traits and track long distance movements.An automated algorithm, which matches the unique spot patterning of new entries to the existing global database is one of the novel features of this site. This component greatly enhances the functionality of the site by allowing faster and more accurate cross-referencing within and between manta ray databases.It is our expectation that researchers will ultimately be able use sightings data to determine the abundance, trends, movements, and population structure of manta ray populations at individual aggregation sites across the globe. This information will help to assess their conservation status and manage wild populations more effectively.Manta Matcher, like all of the Wildbooks, encourages public contributions.

The big problem faced by managers trying to deal with these impacts is that it is very difficult to know where conservation intervention is most useful because little reliable information exists on the nature and true scale of these problems.Reef Life Survey (RLS) aims to improve biodiversity conservation and the sustainable management of marine resources through the collection of high-quality biodiversity information at spatial and temporal scales beyond those possible by scientific dive teams (which have to work with increasingly limited resources). RLS consists of a network of trained, committed recreational SCUBA divers, and an Advisory Committee made up of managers and scientists with direct needs for the data collected, and recreational diver representatives (RLS Advisory Committee).The RLS diver network undertakes scientific assessment of reef habitats using visual census methods, through a combination of targeted survey expeditions organised at priority locations under the direction of the Advisory Committee, and through the regular survey diving activity of trained divers in their local waters. Building the network of divers with a very high skill level is an ongoing process, and training opportunities exist when a combination of funding and interest and enthusiasm from divers with appropriate experience allow (more information for interested divers can be found on the Documents page). Scientific rigor of data collected by RLS divers is achieved and maintained through limiting participation to only those with long-term commitment to the program, intensive training and ongoing assistance by scientists, and through the use of a level system that requires divers to maintain skills (More information can be found at the Documents page).RLS was initiated by researchers at the University of Tasmania with seed funding provided by the Commonwealth Environment Research Facilities (CERF) Program, an Australian Government initiative supporting world class, public good research. The program now forms the core activity of the Reef Life Survey Foundation Incorporated 2013 a not for profit Australian organisation, but still with support from the University of Tasmania, which houses and manages the RLS database. The data are freely available to the public for non-profit purposes, so not only managers, but also groups such as local dive clubs or schools may use these data to look at changes over time in their own local reefs. By making data freely available and through public outputs, including this website, RLS aims to raise broader community awareness of the status of Australia2019s marine biodiversity and associated conservation issues.Despite the Australian focus, data collected elsewhere across the globe by RLS trained divers are also utilised in applied scientific outputs 2013 and through the long term, RLS is expected to play a key role in the management and conservation of the world2019s marine biodiversity and resources.",

In the wild, Macadamia trees are generally found in small populations, scattered in rainforest remnants. Clearing for settlement and agriculture has led to the loss of over 80% Macadamia habitat and the trees themselves; though in many areas, the delicious nut provided by some Macadamia species meant they were left standing while the forest around them was cleared. Early conservation efforts in the late 1800s, also led to the planting of nuts from wild trees in backyards across south east Queensland, north east New South Wales and further afield. Understanding the genetic composition of wild trees - both where they naturally occur (in-situ) and where they have been transplanted (ex-situ) is important for conservation and the future of the macadamia industry (which was founded on very few trees and has limited genetic diversity). This project is being undertaken in partnership with the Macadamia Conservation Trust, Brisbane City Council and Hort Innovation.",

        "descrip": "In late Summer, after leaving the nesting colony, Purple Martins gather in large flocks to feed, socialize and rest before migrating.  This activity, known as pre-migratory roosting can attract thousands of birds to one small area.  Martins also form winter roosts on their South American wintering grounds were they will often flock together with other martin species.Project Martin Roost is a cooperative research project between the PMCA, its members, and bird enthusiasts everywhere.  It is designed to protect and promote Purple Martin roosts in North and South America.The first step in conserving Purple Martin roosts is documenting their occurrence.  Radar images suggest that more than 350 migratory roosts occur in the eastern U.S. and Canada; however most of these locations are undocumented.  Where exactly are these roost sites?  How many exist in North and South America?  Are there any issues with established roost sites?  This is where you can help the most!If you have visited a roost please submit a report.  Keep in mind that roosts do occasionally move and knowing whether a roost is still active at the previous or new location is very important.  Some roosts have been detected with radar, but it may not be known how many martins are there.  Please consider visiting some of these roosts to help improve the roost database.  With your help we can help to protect and improve roosting locations for martins throughout the range.",

Your photos can become research-grade data that will help us discover, monitor and ultimately conserve these unique and treasured mountain ecosystems.The more photos that are posted, the more we can capture the large variability that is inherent in mountain environments across space and time in the northeastern United States. This data will be merged with our ongoing plant phenology studies and used to discover long-term trends in mountain ecosystems.Thank you for joining the Northeast Alpine Flower Watch!",

You will be helping collect data to be used by us and by the US Forest Service2019s i-Tree team to better understand the benefits that these trees deliver.Mission actions:1. Map trees you find in your neighborhood2. Photograph the trees. In particular try and get photos of leaves, flowers, fruit and bark of the tree as this helps us to identify the species if you dont know it.3. Measure the trunk diameter.4. Identify the species if you know it.You can also record notes and hashtags on a tree with any other useful information that you think is worth including.",

        "descrip": "Marine microbes play a critical role in sustaining our planet. They are small organisms of immense significance, producing ~50% of the oxygen in Earth2019s atmosphere and removing much of its carbon dioxide. However, due to climate change, their ocean habitats are undergoing unprecedented change; parts of the ocean are warming and becoming more acidic. How marine microbes experience this increasingly variable environment is an important question for ocean scientists to consider because impacts to microbes will cascade all the way through socio-ecological systems; the future of marine microbes is a global concern.The ocean is vast and remains largely unexplored, rendering a significant challenge for oceanographic research. Through representative models of the ocean2019s surface circulation, Adrift provides a simulated web environment that makes all parts of the ocean accessible and allows unprecedented aggregation of data across the dynamic seascape. Our objective in this project is to characterise the experience of drifting marine microbes in order to more accurately test their environmental tolerances in laboratory experiments.Adrift calls on citizen scientists to help map the ocean trajectories of marine microbes within the simulated web environment. By compiling data along drift trajectories, citizens will help ocean scientists better understand the biological experiences of marine microbes and more accurately predict their future.",
